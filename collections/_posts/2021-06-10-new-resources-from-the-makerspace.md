# Workshops and Tutorials

One good thing about working remotely for a year is that I had more time
to work on writing up some workshops and tutorials. 

I set an ambitious goal to host five workshops this semester. My plan was to
teach the workshop virtually, and take very good notes and documentation so
that I can turn them into workshop guides (for anyone to be able to teach the
same workshop) and tutorials (so anyone can learn the skill and make the
"thing").

I completed three workshops on the Arduino, one workshop about the Raspberry Pi
and one workshop about how to easily, and freely, make a website.

I also co-taught an Architecture class this semester where I led instruction on
using Arduinos. As a result of that, I put together several Arduino tutorials.

So I am presenting those here for your enjoyment and education!

## Workshops

A [new section of the Makerspace website](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/makerspace/#workshop-links) will
list workshop resources. These resources are intended for K-12 teachers,
makerspace staff, or anyone wanting to teach a workshop. The workshop resources
include a slideshow and script for workshop instructors to show and follow. 


The first one, The Basics of Electricity and Making a Nightlight is available now.

More workshop resources will follow.

## Tutorials

A [new section of the Makerspace website](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/makerspace/#tutorial-links) will
list tutorials, which are self-paced guides to complete a task and learn a skill.

This past year I was able to put together three different sets of tutorials.

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>A set of tutorials for using the Arduino micro controller.</p>
		<a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/arduino-tuts/"><img style="width: 60%; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0px 15px 20px 1px #DBDBDB" src="/assets/post-media/workshops/arduino-image.jpg"></a>
		<p><a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/arduino-tuts/">https://ammonshepherd.github.io/arduino-tuts/</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>A tutorial on how to use GitHub and VS Code to create and maintain a simple website for free.</p>
		<a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/make-a-website/"><img style="width: 60%" src="/assets/post-media/workshops/website.png"></a>
		<p><a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/make-a-website/">https://ammonshepherd.github.io/make-a-website/</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>A tutorial to explain Git and set up your computer for using it with VS Code and GitHub.</p>
		<a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/git-for-beginners/"><img style="width: 60%" src="/assets/post-media/workshops/git.png"></a>
		<p><a href="https://ammonshepherd.github.io/git-for-beginners/">https://ammonshepherd.github.io/git-for-beginners/</a></p>
	</li>
</ul>


If you happen to go through any of the tutorials or workshops, when you come
across errors or have ideas to make the text more clear, <a href="mailto:ammon@virginia.edu">please send them along! </a>
