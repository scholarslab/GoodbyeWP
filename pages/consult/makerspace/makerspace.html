<section id="mission">
	<h2>Mission + Vision</h2>
	<p>All humans are dreamers, creators, and achievers. Our mission is to provide the place, the tools, and the support to empower people to dream, create and achieve. The Scholars' Lab Makerspace is strategically situated within the UVA Library to be open, provide a low barrier of entry to making, and be a helpful resource of information, technology and support. Our space is open to everyone, including the public, and proactively encourages those in underrepresented academic studies, ethnicities, genders, economic classes and skill levels to come learn, make, and research.</p>
    <p>The Makerspace staff provides consultations and instruction for all your electronics, crafting, textiles, laser cutting, and 3D printing projects <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours/">whenever the Makerspace is open</a>, or by appointment. Please drop in, or send inquiries to <a href="mailto:slabmakerspace@virginia.edu">slabmakerspace@virginia.edu</a>.</p>
	<p>Or schedule a consultation with Ammon, manager of our Makerspace.</p>

<div id="buttons">
	<h3>Buttons</h3>
	<p>We have two different sized button makers; 1.5-inch and 2.25-inch. Due to the popularity and cost of button supplies, there is a 12 button per person per semester limit. The resources are intended for personal use.</p>
	<p>Clubs and other organizations who would like to make more than 12 buttons can purchase their own supplies and use our button presses. The <a href="https://www.buttonmakers.net/225buttons">2.25-inch button kit</a> from <a href="https://buttonmakers.net">ButtonMakers.net</a> is the recommended option.</p>

	<h3>3D Printing</h3>
	<p>We have five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication">FFF</a> style printers and one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Resin (SLA)</a> printer available for reservation. To use the printers, you can come in during open hours for in-person training and on-the-spot reservation. In order to reserve the FFF printers before coming to the Makerspace, you will need to complete an on-line certification.</p>
	
	<a id="3d-printer-certification" class="makerspace-button" href="https://virginia.libwizard.com/f/3D_printer_certification">3D Printer Certification</a>

	<p>Resin printer certification is forthcoming.</p>
	<p>Self-service 3D printing is also available through the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/3d-printing/">3D Printing Studio</a> in the Robertson Media Center in Clemons Library. To use the printers there, you need to complete an <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/3d-printing/">online training</a>, then reserve a 3D printer during their <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">open hours</a>. Email <a href="mailto:teachlearn@virginia.edu">teachlearn@virginia.edu</a> with any questions.</p>
 	<p>The 3D printers are completely different from each other in each space, so training on 3D Printing Studio printers does not automatically grant access to the Makerspace printers.</p>
