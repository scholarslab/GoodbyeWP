Scott Bailey was a former full-time Digital Humanities Developer; he was previously a 2013-2014 Praxis Fellow. During those roles, his bio text was:

I am a digital humanities developer in the Scholars' Lab and a Ph.D. candidate in philosophical theology, writing a dissertation examining vulnerability at the intersection of theological anthropology and neuroscience.

After years working heavily in theological ontology and metaphysics, I have a burgeoning interest in Javascript application frameworks, the role of the humanities in public discourse, and the pedagogical use of digital technologies.
