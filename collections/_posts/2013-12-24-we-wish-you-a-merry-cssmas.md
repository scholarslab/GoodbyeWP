While I plan on taking some time off over Christmas and New Year's to be with family and friends, I also plan on fine-tuning my programing skills over the break. At the suggestion of Jeremy the first step is diving into tutorials (which involves equal part determination and motivation).

As you may have gathered from [my last post ](http://www.scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/tongue-tied-in-css/) I plan on starting with the very first lesson: [What is CSS?](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/learning_what_css_is)  ;)

See you all in the New Year!
