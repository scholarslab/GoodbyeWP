This week Cecilia and took a few hours and completed one of our goals for this semester: creating a tutorial video for using Prism.   Not only did this turn out to be surprisingly fun (due mostly to Cecilia’s amazing antics), but it also added a few more skills to the list of things we have learned through Praxis.

First---though this might seem trivial-- we got to draw upon out teaching skills, devising a plan for how to teach someone to use Prism in under three minutes.  I authored the tutorial, and thanks to some great ad lib from Cecilia, I think the tutorial manages to capture the playful attitude with which we have approached our work and which we hope Prism engenders.

In addition, we learned how to use the [iShowU HD](http://www.shinywhitebox.com/ishowu-hd/) software program.  Admittedly, this is a very user-friendly program which allows you to record an area on your screen as a video.  Still, it has left us with one more skill which we can confidently claim for our own.

And finally, and perhaps most importantly, we got to use this awesome microphone.   Need I say more?

The launch of Prism is just around the corner.  In the mean time, check out our [tutorial here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxHDcW15UBI)!
