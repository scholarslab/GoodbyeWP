One good thing about living in this age is instant access to information.  What could be better than that?  Maps!

The USGS has up-to-the-minute maps for earthquakes all over the world.  For the latest Virginia events click [here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US2/37.39.-79.-77.php).  You can find their main earthquake page [here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/).

The USGS also has a crowd-sourced program - called Do You Feel It? - where users can gauge the quake at their location and report back to help build the map below.  More on that program [here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/).

The good people at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/) created some cool maps just after the largest Virginia quake using publicly-available data and some tools from the guys at [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/).  Please click [here](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/aug/23/map-todays-east-cost-earthquake-available-mapbox) to see how they quickly mashed up the earthquake data to make some great maps.

Though, I think the most interesting visualization is this [animated one](http://youtu.be/IKE7MLNdtcg), showing the earth rippling like a pond.
