Bluegrass music in the Czech Republic -- there's a lot of it, and there's a lot of history and variety to the music-making. In addition to participant-observation and other person-level ethnographic work with folks who are part of the Czech bluegrass community, I broaden my work through web-based interactions. My online "Bluegrassová Mapa Ceské Republiky," which is in construction with help from the UVA library and the [Bluegrassova Asociace Ceske Republiky](http://www.bacr.cz/english.php) will help widen the perspective of my dissertation, indicate the extent of bluegrass activity in Czech Republic to outsiders, and enable new local community and inter-community connections.
