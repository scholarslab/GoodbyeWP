This year's [Praxis](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) fellows are in the last couple weeks of programming before our release of the new Ivanhoe Game (rebuilt as a [WordPress Theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/)), and we are looking for people to test the program.

The Ivanhoe Game is a pedagogical and critical tool which enables scholars or students to generate discussion and criticism on a subject through role-play.  The original Ivanhoe Game was conceived in the early 2000s by Jerome McGann and Johanna Drucker; they were then joined by Bethany Nowviskie, Nick Laiacona, and others to develop the game in UVa's SpecLab/ARP--one of several precursors to the [Scholars' Lab](http://www.scholarslab.org/).  You can learn more at [http://www.ivanhoegame.org/?page_id=21](http://www.ivanhoegame.org/?page_id=21)

Potential uses of the Ivanhoe Game WP Theme include:



	
  * Critical back-and-forth game play among scholars interested in applying different theoretical schools of thought to the same work.  For instance, in a game on _The Tempest,_ one scholar might elect to 'be' Freud, another a Postcolonialist, and another a feminist critic; and the 'moves' might constitute asides written by these players in response to action in the play.

	
  * Students in a course on textual editing or book history might take on roles as different people involved in the publication of a hypothetical or real book: author, editor, compositor, illustrator, printer, binder, bookseller, etc.!

	
  * Law students can take on roles in a digital mock trial, making moves for various motions, documentary evidence, arguments, witness statements, testimony, etc.

	
  * History students in a course on the American Revolution might take on roles as King George II, the Founding Fathers, generals and soldiers in various armies, and others.


This is just to name a few; the possibilities are endless!  Ivanhoe's construction as a WP Theme means that it can be easily incorporated into already existing WP pages, including course pages.  For a completely bare-bones idea of what Ivanhoe will be, [visit our testing app Games page](http://ivanhoe-staging.herokuapp.com/?post_type=ivanhoe_game), hosted on [Heroku.](https://www.heroku.com/)

We hope to start testing on April 8.  We are looking for varying levels of commitment.  For a larger number of testers, 20-30 minutes a week would be helpful for us.  For a few testers who have the time and interest, we hope for 2-5 hours a week.

If you are interested, please fill out the form below.  I will contact you within a week to make arrangements for testing.
