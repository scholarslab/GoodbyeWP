ICYMI, applications to be a part of the 2020-2021 Praxis Program in the Scholars' Lab are due March 1st! This is a chance to ask all your questions about the fellowship or the application process as you put together materials to be a part of a collaborative team working on a digital project. If you can’t make it or want to discuss an application sooner, don’t hesitate to reach out to Head of Student Programs Brandon Walsh at bmw9t@virginia.edu.

More information about the fellowship available [here](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/praxis-program-fellowships/).
