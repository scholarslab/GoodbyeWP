Dr. Amanda Wyatt Visconti is Managing Director of the Scholars' Lab. They hold a Literature Ph.D. from the University of Maryland focused on the digital humanities and textual scholarship, and an M.S. in Information from the University of Michigan focused on DH and human-computer interaction. They have also worked as a professional web developer for over a decade, with specialization in online knowledge-building communities, meaningful crowdsourcing websites, and reading/annotation interfaces. 

Amanda currently contributes to the scholarship of experimental and digital humanities policy and practice, bringing both critical-practical approaches to infrastructure and community design underlying scholarly innovation. They are an enthusiastic blogger, both on their [LiteratureGeek.com](https://literaturegeek.com) blog and on [the Scholars' Lab blog](https://Scholarslab.org/blog), as well as a popular speaker and advisor for institutions exploring digital and expermental scholarship initiatives.

They serve as an appointed officer (and previously an elected representative) of the [Association for Computing and the Humanities](http://ach.org) (ACH) executive council, the founder and ongoing administrator of the 3k-member [Digital Humanities Slack](http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack), [Digital Ethnic Futures](http://digitalethnicfutures.org/) Mentor, and an appointed Technical Advisory Board member for [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/). They previously served as an appointed member of the [Modern Languages Association](http://mla.org) (MLA) Information Technology Committee; and as an editor, technical board member, and then ombudsperson for _[The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)_.

Amanda's 2015 dissertation ([Dr.AmandaVisconti.com](http://Dr.AmandaVisconti.com)) was the first humanities dissertation to fully acknowledge digital methods (code, design, user testing, blogging, no chapters) as scholarship by treating them *as* the dissertation instead of addenda to traditional written chapters. The focus of their dissertation was creating the participatory digital edition of James Joyce's _Ulysses_ [InfiniteUlysses.com](http://InfiniteUlysses.com), which attracted over 12,000 unique visitors in its first few weeks of open beta and was cited in _The New York Times_ in July 2016. 

As [SLab Doge](https://github.com/slab-doge) and [@Scholars_Lab](http://twitter.com/scholars_lab)'s human, their greatest ambition is to be better known for creating and contributing to scholarly community bulding (including via SLab Dog Club!) than for their Joyce research. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/krishrach/a-man-has-built-a-train-for-all-his-adopted-stray-dogs?utm_term=.dnyk87JQ3#.vpGOG8JzA">Becoming conductor of a dog train</a> wouldn't be so bad, either.
