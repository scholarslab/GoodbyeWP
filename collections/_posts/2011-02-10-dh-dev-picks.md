Part of mission here at the Scholars' Lab is provide guidance for folks working on digital projects. As such, I do my best to keep up with trends in software development. For a while I've just been adding these to my [delicious account](http://www.delicious.com/wsgrah) to make it a bit easier to find references later. However, recent trends in the way Yahoo! is handling its properties (specifically with delicious), made the think a bit harder about this approach and I thought I might try something else. The idea here is to have a regular series of posts with links that I find interesting and I think are are of some utility to other DH developers.



	
  * [Awesome Fontstacks](http://awesome-fontstacks.com/): If you're a developer who does design, or a designer who codes, browser support for beautiful fonts opens a lot of doors for creating compelling presentations of your work.

	
  * [Using Git to manage a web site](http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto): Web workflows vary widely, but wouldn't it be nice to use your SCM for deploying your web application? This post describes a method of using git to deploy web pages.

	
  * [Getting Comfortable With SSH](http://jcsalterego.github.com/2011/02/04/getting-comfortable-with-ssh.html): I use keys, aliases, and remote tunneling as part of my workflow, and this post provides a nice introduction to all of these. I would be remiss, however, if I didn't point out something they highlight on the post: this method is pretty insecure. After you get your feet wet,Â be sure to check out a much more secure method over on [Github](http://help.github.com/working-with-key-passphrases/)

	
  * [My Github Resume](http://resume.github.com/): Use github? This site does a nice job creating a resume/cv of your code commits

	
  * [31 CSS Code Snippets To Make You A Better Coder](http://www.designyourway.net/blog/resources/31-css-code-snippets-to-make-you-a-better-coder/): If you're like me, I can't keep browser-specific differences in the implementation of the CSS spec straight in my head. These code snippets help. Add them to a program like [Snippely](http://code.google.com/p/snippely/), [SnipMate](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540),
or your favorite IDE, you can throw them in your code as needed.

	
  * [960 Grid on jQuery-Mobile](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/jquery-mobile-960/): I'm a fan of 960 grid and jQuery. While these techniques for use on mobile devices has a way to go, this technique does show some promise.

	
  * [Maze Algorithms](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/): Great set of posts on solving tough problems algorithmically. These are also nice if you're not familiar with the pseudo-code commonly used to express discrete algorithmic logic. Very clear explanation of the problem and the approach used to solve the issues.
