Internet introductions are by far the weirdest introductions because you have no idea who is reading what you’re writing.  For all I know people I went to high-school with will find me here blogging about the Digital Humanities, or a future employer, more likely it will be my mother and grandmother.  So here goes internet...don’t let me down...and hi Mom!

I’m Cecilia Márquez.  I’m have a BA from Swarthmore College in Black Studies and Gender and Sexuality Studies.  Now I’m a second year PhD student in the History Department here at UVA.  My work is mostly focused on African American History, Labor History and Latino History.

My interest in [Praxis](https://praxis.scholarslab.org/) came as a shock to most people who know me.  I have a serious aversion to most technology and an even bigger aversion to being confused.  So a program that focused on embracing and challenging my ignorance of technology felt a little like a leap into the belly of the beast.  I am happy to report that after three meetings I have not felt the desire to run for the door or throw my computer at the wall.

At our first Praxis Team meeting--aside from me laughing nervously at all of the programming jokes I didn’t understand--we talked about our charter.  The conversation made me think more about how my values influenced my interest in the Digital Humanities.

I believe in the importance of working collectively.  Although I often stumble doing this effectively I believe that working in community will always be better than the solitary experience of the library basement.  On a related point I have to laugh all the time, especially when I’m working, and especially when what I’m working on is incredibly hard.  I always want to bring a sense of humor to the work I do and so far the Praxis team has not come up short on good humor.  I’m committed to the democratization of knowledge--both historical knowledge and technological knowledge.  This is obviously central to the work of the Digital Humanities.

The next time I blog I will have gotten through HTML/CSS training... hopefully me and my computer emerge unscathed.
