I'm pleased to announce that the [Scholarly Communication Institute](http://uvasci.org/current-work/) is conducting **a study on career preparation in humanities graduate programs**. As part of this study, we have launched two confidential surveys: the [first is for people on alternative academic career paths](http://alt-academy.questionpro.com/) (that is, people with graduate training in the humanities and allied fields working beyond the professoriate); the [second survey is for their employers](http://alt-academy.employers.questionpro.com/).  The surveys will be open until October 1, 2012.

Humanities scholars **come from a wide array of backgrounds and embark on a variety of careers** in areas like libraries, museums, archives, higher education and humanities administration, publishing, research and technology, and more. SCI anticipates that data collected during the study will contribute to a **deeper understanding of the diversity of career paths** we pursue after our graduate studies, while also highlighting **opportunities to better prepare students for a range of careers** beyond the tenure track.

The surveys **complement the** [**public database**](http://altacademy.wufoo.com/reports/who-we-are/) that we recently created as a way to clarify the breadth of the field, and to foster community among a diverse group. If your work represents the diversity of the broad #alt-ac community, it's not too late to [tell us about yourself!](http://altacademy.wufoo.com/forms/who-we-are/)

The surveys and directory are being administered as part of the Scholarly Communication Institute's [current phase of work](http://uvasci.org/current-work/graduate-education/) -- which includes a close concentration on graduate education reform (largely in the North American context) and the preparation of future knowledge workers, educators, and cultural heritage and scholarly communications professionals.

The survey results will help us to make curriculum recommendations so that graduate programs may better serve future students, and anonymized or summarized data will be made available at [#alt-academy](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/who-we-are) at a later date. Please [contact me ](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/users/katinalynn)if you’d like to know more.
