Collaboration with Dr. Zimmerman began in 2022 through a request to create a life-size, life-like model of a heart that he and other fellows could use to practice the movement of catheters inside the heart. Ideally the model would be clear and hollow. Due to time constraints the project was put on hold until the summer of 2023. 

The original request was unable to be created due to the limitations of FFF printers and our lack of quality resin for our Form 2 printer.

So, like all good projects, we came up with the next best thing; a 3D printed, life-size heart with extra holes to make it usable for practice surgery.

I found a version online at [https://www.printables.com/model/5612-anatomic-heart-multi-material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwrYMWoqg5w), which provided the perfect model.

My 3D printed version came out pretty close!

After viewing this version, Dr. Zimmerman had a few alterations in mind that would improve the model. I was able to pull the .stl files from printables.com into Autodesk Fusion for digital manipulation.

The first attempt made sure the atrium and ventricle pieces could fit together and included most of the holes. I forgot a few, and Dr. Zimmerman had a couple more altercations, so it was back to the proverbial drawing board.

The second attempt was "good enough"&trade; even if orange in color. I think I gave him a couple of versions in a more medical white or red.

Dr. Zimmerman was very grateful for the heart models and noted that they would be useful for learning anatomy and showing patients what would be done to their hearts during surgery.
