A video stream of the final event of our NEH-funded [Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship](http://scholarslab.org/geospatial) (or [#geoinst](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23geoinst) as it's known on Twitter) is now available!  Thanks to all our wonderful participants for making these lightning talks, collectively entitled "Frontiers in Spatial Humanities," so thought-provoking.

The Scholars' Lab/NEH Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship was held at the University of Virginia Library May 25-27, 2010 and concluded with a set of two-minute, three-slide lightning talks by Institute attendees on their own spatial humanities projects and works-in-progress.
