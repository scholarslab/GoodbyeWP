Swati Chawla was a 2014-15 Praxis Fellow and a Ph.D candidate in history at the University of Virginia. She has always been curious about how and why people make their homes in new places, and is currently pursuing this question through her research on Tibetan exile in India. She was trained in literary studies at the University of Delhi, where she taught as an assistant professor before coming to UVa.
