Our Spring 2013 newsletter (pdf) is [available for download](http://static.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013spring-1-final.pdf).

In this issue, you'll find information about Chris Gist and Kelly Johnston's GIS Workshop series, an update on the Scholarly Communication Institute's activities, and a round up of what the SLab staff have been up to as we get [out and about](http://www.scholarslab.org/announcements/slab-out-about/), spreading the digital humanities joy.

We hope you enjoy it!
