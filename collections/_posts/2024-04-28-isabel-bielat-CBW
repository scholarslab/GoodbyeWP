# Introduction
In the aftermath of the Great War, the Bengali educator Panchanan Bhattacharyya published a collective biography analyzing the virtues of twenty Indian women from the mythic era to the present. An unusual text among pre-1940 Anglophone collective biographies of women, [Ideals of Indian Womanhood (Calcutta: Goldquin & Co., 1921)] (http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/books_display.php?id=1399) draws moral lessons from the lives of Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim women in Indian literature and history. When formatting Bhattacharyya’s text for the Collective Biographies of Women database, I recognized important relationships to the biographical practices represented throughout the database, particularly to those examples our team selected for “A World World One Gallery of Women.” In the process of selecting and retelling the featured life narratives, Bhattacharyya portrays the ideal Indian woman as resisting the ancient injustices of religious intolerance and familial strife, while simultaneously continuing a tradition of femininity distinct from the Westernized, Christianized New Woman represented in [other collective biographies of his era] (http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/books.php?collection_title=&collection_title-id=&author_name=&author_name-id=&unique_id=&collection_type_logic=AND&year_logic=OR&collection_years%5B%5D=1919&collection_years%5B%5D=1920&collection_years%5B%5D=1921&search_logic=OR&form_submit=Search). At a pivotal historical moment, and with the support of various intellectuals associated with the Bengali Renaissance, Bhattacharyya’s didactic project intervenes in complex narratives of nation, empire, gender, and religious reform.
