We are thrilled to announce the 2022-2023 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 7 fellows from 6 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past students!

## Praxis Program

We are delighted to welcome 5 team members to the 12th (!) year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:

*	Malcolm Cammeron, History
*	Caroline Carter, Art and Architectural History
*	Lauren Garcia, Sociology
*	Winnie Pérez Martínez, Spanish
*	Samantha Stephens, English

Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s work in the fall!

## Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities

Finally, we are looking forward to working with Rebecca Brown and Eleanore Neumann, our 2022-2023 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.

*	Rebecca Brown's (Music, Composition & Computer Technologies) dissertation is titled "*Fireside seats at the Star Chamber*, a multimedia composition"
*	Eleanore Neumann's (Art and Architectural History) dissertation is titled "Maria Graham (1785-1842) and the Gendered Landscape"

These fellows will work with our team throughout the year and over the summer on substantial research projects related to their dissertations. They join a vibrant community of students working in the lab in the coming year.

Special thanks to everyone who served on the application committees that selected these fantastic students. We are looking forward to working with all of them in the coming year!
