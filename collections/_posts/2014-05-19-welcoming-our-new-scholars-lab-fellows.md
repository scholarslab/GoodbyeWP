We are thrilled to announce our partnership with 9 new graduate fellows for the 2014-2015 academic year! Joining an illustrious [community of past recipients](http://www.scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/) of Scholars’ Lab Fellowships, the new cohort hail from 5 disciplines in the [humanities and social sciences at the University of Virginia.](http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/home/index.html)

**James Ambuske**, **Jennifer Foy** , and **Emily Senefeld** join us as our three [Digital Humanities Graduate Fellows](http://www.scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowship-in-digital-humanities/). Throughout the year, they will have the opportunity to collaborate closely with Scholars’ Lab staff to integrate digital tools and methods to their dissertation research.

James Ambuske's dissertation is titled "Scotland's American Revolution: Emigration and Imperial Crisis, 1763-1803."

Jennifer Foy's dissertation is titled "Mapping Sympathy: Sensibility, Stigma, and Space in the Long Eighteenth Century"

Emily Senefeld project is titled "The Cultural Programs of the Highlander Folk School, 1932-1964."

James, Jennifer, and Emily's projects converge around questions of social networks and mapping. We are looking forward to seeing their projects develop.

This year marks the 4th year of our [Praxis Program!](http://praxis.scholarslab.org) Past Praxis teams developed [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org), a web application for crowd-based interpretations of texts, and re-imagined [Ivanhoe](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org), a platform for playfully (and collaboratively) interpreting texts and artifacts. This year’s cohort will refine Ivanhoe as well as explore our new Maker Space.

_** 2014-2015 Praxis Fellows**_ are:

Amy Boyd (English)
Swati Chawla (History)
Andrew Ferguson (English)
Joris Gjata (Sociology)
Jennifer Grayburn (Art and Architecture)
and Steven Lewis (Music)

Look for more information about our fellows in the early fall on the Scholars’ Lab blog.
