The Scholars' Lab has significant public and staff office space, consisting of the 3rd floor east wing in UVA's Shannon Library building, just west of UVA's Lawn and Rotunda. Our public space is dedicated to inspiring and strengthening interdisciplinary digital scholarship, with our core focus on the intersections of technology, culture, and social justice.

Intentional community design—and active learning and work toward welcoming, inclusive, equitable, and anti-racist practice as a major part of that–is core to what Scholars' Lab does. We'd love to see you in person, and help you explore the ways into UVA's DH community possible through our physical and virtual spaces!
