Back in October [I wrote a blog post](https://scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/are-we-gaming-or-just-simulating/) pushing back on the idea that we were actually creating a game.* Using Gredler's (2004) work on games vs simulations I was arguing that while we were calling Ivanhoe a game we weren't incorporating essential elements of game-play (i.e. rules, goals, the ability to win, etc). [As we begin wire-framing](https://scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/turning-points-in-praxis-new-roles-wire-frames-and-programming-languages/), these same questions are coming into play again: should we have a role journal? what about points?

Such a conversation got me thinking again about what we're actually making. To help me with this struggle, I ordered a copy of [The Gamification of Learning and Instruction Fieldbook ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111867443X/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) written by Karl Kapp, Lucas Blair, and Rich Mesh (2014). By reading their book I came to realize that we're not producing a game _or_ a simulation...we are actually incorporating gamification. Gamification means that we are using elements of games to create a more engaging pedagogical environment.

As Kapp et al write, "Gamificiation is using game-based mechanics, aesthetics, and game-thinking to engage people, motivate action, promote learning, and solve problems" (2014: 54). Moreover, I think Ivanhoe is using more _content gamification _vs_ structural gamification_. While these are not mutually exclusive ideas, it seems that we want to create a product that "makes the content more game-like but doesn't turn the content into a game" (pg 55).

Such a revelation about what we were making gave me a renewed sense of energy about our product.  By working with the elements of gamification we can "encourage learners to progress through content, motivate action, influence behavior, and drive innovation" (pg 56). In doing so, we can make something that enhances learning and hopefully adds a bit more enjoyment to our classroom.
