Do you have a list of Lat/Lon coordinates you would like to see on a map? We will show you how to do that, and more. ArcGIS Pro makes it easy to take your tabular data and generate stylized points on a map.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 2PM to 3PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration is open until 1 hour before class.
