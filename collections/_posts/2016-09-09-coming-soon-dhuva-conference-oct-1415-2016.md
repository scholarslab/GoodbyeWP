After you enjoy NEH@50 celebrations, and in between this fall's workshops and speakers, come to an intimate conference on digital humanities, right here on Grounds, Friday and Saturday October 14 and 15, 2016.  We've been developing an interesting conference program aimed at building the DH community at UVA.  At this event we'll also be further introducing the design and purposes of the website (in development): [http://dh.virginia.edu/](http://dh.virginia.edu/).  This event's reflection on the present and future is a joint effort of ITS, the Library, Arts & Sciences, and the Provost's Office; [Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org/), [IATH](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/), and [SHANT](http://shanti.virginia.edu/)I.

Events are free and open to the public. We'll be looking for faculty and graduate students to participate in the program, so please reply to Rennie (see below) or to me, booth@virginia.edu if interested in a lightning talk, participation in a roundtable, or otherwise.

For more preliminary detail, here is the Save the Date message prepared by the Project Manager of the conference, Rennie Mapp:
Dear members of the UVa DH community:

Please plan to attend DH@UVa 2016 on Friday, October 14 and Saturday, October 15 in the Harrison/Small Auditorium of the Special Collections Library. We'll be considering the present and future of the Digital Humanities at the University of Virginia.

Conference sessions will include panel discussions with outside speakers, lightning talks, break-out conversations, pop-up brainstorming, and opportunities to talk informally with others at UVa who are interested in the Digital Humanities (broadly speaking). The public, faculty, staff of the libraries and other organizations, and students at the University are most welcome!

Soon I'll be notifying you about open registration for these events on our website. The conference is FREE but we appreciate notice that you'll attend so that we can plan food, refreshments, and space. In the meantime, please mark your calendar and consider giving a lightning talk or formulating a good topic for a break-out conversation. If you have any questions or thoughts about the conference, please contact me, Rennie Mapp (conference manager), at rcmapp@gmail.com

This conference is sponsored by Ron Hutchins, VP for Information Technology. It is organized by Alison Booth, Director of Scholars' Lab; David Germano, Director of SHANTI; and Worthy Martin, Director of IATH--in consultation and with the active support of Archie Holmes, Associate Provost for Academic Affairs; John Unsworth, Dean of Libraries and University Librarian; and Francesca Fiorani, Associate Dean for Arts and Humanities.
