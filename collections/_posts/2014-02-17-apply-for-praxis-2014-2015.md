UVa grad students! **Apply by March 10th** for a unique, funded opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary group of your peers, learning digital humanities skills from the experts, and collaboratively designing and executing an innovative digital project.

Each year, the Scholars’ Lab [Praxis Program](https://praxis.scholarslab.org) provides six UVa graduate students with hands-on experience in digital humanities collaboration and project creation. Team members work to take a shared project from conception to design and development, and finally to publication, community engagement, and analysis.

Our fellows [blog about their experiences ](https://scholarslab.org/archives/)and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our wonderful [faculty and staff](https://scholarslab.org/people/)) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods.

The [2013-14 Praxis cohor](https://praxis.scholarslab.org)t is in full swing, thanks to a generous support by the [University of Virginia Library](http://library.virginia.edu/).  Recently, the Scholars’ Lab joined with like-minded institutions to create a [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org/), made up of allied but differently-inflected humanities education initiatives from around the world, mainly focused on graduate training, and all engaged in rethinking pedagogy and campus partnerships in relation to the digital humanities.

**We will welcome six new, competitively-selected Praxis students in late August 2014**. Each will be awarded $8000 in fellowship funds, and will be expected to devote approximately 10 hours per week in the fall and spring semesters, to learning together and building a collaborative digital humanities project in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of our dedicated grad lounge.

All _University of Virginia graduate students_ working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply to join the 2014-15 cohort. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.

**Application deadline: Monday, March 10th.**
The application process is simple: direct an email to [Purdom Lindblad](mailto:jpl8e@virginia.edu). Please indicate why you’re interested in the Praxis Program, what you think you will gain from it, and what you feel you would bring to a collaborative digital humanities project. A small committee, consisting of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff and past Praxis Program participants, will evaluate expressions of interest and schedule group interviews with finalists.
