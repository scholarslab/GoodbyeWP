**Scholars' Lab Speaker Series: Dr. Mills Kelly**
**Pedagogy of Disruption: What Happens When You Teach Students to Lie?**

On October 25, 2012, [Dr. Mills Kelly](http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/tkelly7), Director of the Global Affairs Program in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University, spoke on how student learning might be transformed if traditional modes of instruction were turned on their head. In his talk, Kelly, the professor of GMU’s “Lying About the Past” course, explores the up and downsides of disruptive approaches to teaching and learning.
