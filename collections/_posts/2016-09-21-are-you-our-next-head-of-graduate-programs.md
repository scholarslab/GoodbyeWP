"We build up people and practices more than products." That's part of our [charter](http://scholarslab.org/about/charter/), and the Head of Graduate Programs is essential to this mission.  We in the Scholars' Lab and University of Virginia Library are thrilled to alert you to the new job posting [https://jobs.virginia.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=80148](https://jobs.virginia.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=80148)

As the description on the University of Virginia job site emphasizes, the primary responsibilities focus on the [Praxis Program](https://praxis.scholarslab.org) and other graduate DH Fellowships.  "Mentoring, managing day-to-day operations, and coordinating staff support for both team-based and individual graduate fellowship programs at U.Va. Library. Developing intellectual programming in the digital humanities for the Scholars' Lab and building community among emerging scholars at U.Va. Fostering collaboration on humanities training and research support with internal and external partners."  The Head of Graduate Programs works closely with graduate programs around the university to arrange fellowships and collaborates with librarians in enhancing the digital curriculum.  Feel free to imagine how you might weave your own interests and research into these responsibilities (we make time for staff members to pursue research projects).  We look for talent in communication and community building, experience in the context of digital research and instruction, and familiarity with graduate studies in your discipline(s): "Master's degree or equivalent in the humanities or humanistic aspects of information science."

This is a great time to join the broad and deep teams of digital scholarship at the University of Virginia, with our new Dean of Libraries John Unsworth and the University's reconfirmed commitment to innovative humanities research in the biggest tent of DH.  Scholars' Lab collaborates with the [Carter G. Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies ](http://woodson.virginia.edu/)and the [Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures](http://ihgc.as.virginia.edu/).  The Head of Graduate Programs can help shape both the research agenda and the series of workshops and public programs that serve the entire University community, along with the Scholars' Lab's directors, the Head of Public Programs, and others in this collaborative center within the Library.

**Salary and Benefits:**
Salary is commensurate with experience, and expected in the $65,000 - $75,000 range per annum. Excellent benefits, TIAA/CREF and other retirement plans along with generous funding for travel and professional development.
