My name is Malikia Johnson and I am rising Junior at [Howard University](http://www2.howard.edu/) majoring in Sociology and Africana Studies. My research focuses on the representation of African- American women in K-12 textbooks and the effect this has on the cultural identity of young African- American girls ages 7 to 9.
