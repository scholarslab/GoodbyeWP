In 2019, the Scholars' Lab and UVA Library received funding from the <a href="https://uvaparents.virginia.edu/parents-fund/projects-funded/">UVA Parents Fund</a> to create documentation for working with augmented and virtual reality technologies on campus. The following posts were produced as an outcome from that project.
{% assign project_posts = site.posts | where: 'tags', 'Parents Fund' %}
<ul>
{% for post in project_posts %}
{% capture authorstring %}
{% include author-name.html authorid=post.author %}
{% endcapture %}
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> by {{ authorstring }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
