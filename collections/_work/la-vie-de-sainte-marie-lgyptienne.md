The core of Loren Lee's dissertation work is a digital edition and translation of Version T of La Vie de sainte Marie l'Égyptienne, a twelfth-century Anglo-Norman verse redaction of this Desert Mother's Life. Version T survives in eight manuscript copies, and her digital edition seeks to help readers visualize the meaningful variations among these copies.
