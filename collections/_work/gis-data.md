We recommend [ArcGIS Online](https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/gis/software#s-lib-ctab-20595149-4) as a starting point in your search for spatial data. There, the Scholars' Lab maintains limited regional and historic GIS datasets that can be found in a map search or on our [Open Data Portal](https://data-uvalibrary.opendata.arcgis.com/). 

National and International base data, census and political boundaries and variables, elevation layers, network datasets, and lots of other spatial data can be found on [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/). 

If you are looking for digital elevation models, orthoimagery, land use, etc. for the United States, we recommend the National Map: [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/)

The best worldwide digital elevation models are ASTER datasets available for download from the USGS EarthExplorer: [http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

Another good source for U.S. data is the [National Atlas](http://nationalatlas.gov/).

Check out the [Data tab] on our LibGuide for more options.
