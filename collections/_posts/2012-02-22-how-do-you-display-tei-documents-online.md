As you can see from [Zane’s post a few days ago](http://www.scholarslab.org/tei/commentary-on-migrating-an-omeka-site/), we’ve been hard at work on our update to [TEIDisplay](http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/TeiDisplay) here at UT-Austin. While he’s been working to jive the plugin with the newest version of Omeka, I’ve been thinking more about how this tool will be used. While I’ve studied TEI and used it in a few distinct scenarios, I’m still a newcomer to the world of digital humanities. In order to make the best product possible, we need more feedback from our potential users – you! I’ve put up a post over at [DH Answers](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/) to learn more about what TEI display tools (if any) people are using, and what features are most important. [Please join the conversation by giving us your feedback!](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/topic/how-do-you-display-tei-documents-online?replies=1#post-1525)
