**CFP is subject to funding availability. There will be no call for fellows the 2019-2020 cycle.**

The Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship allows UVa graduate students to work with our R&D team for a single semester to rapidly develop their digital project ideas and position themselves for future work in digital humanities. The Scholars’ Lab offers these fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development. This program offers support to projects that might not fit the normal scope of the other fellowship programs: proposed projects may be collaborative, offer unusual outcomes, or represent significant departures from previous research. The fellowship is meant to help students rapidly aquire skills, to wireframe or prototype a project, and perhaps implement the first stages of a plan for further study.

The fellowship carries with it a stipend of $5000, and fellows are expected to select a semester during which their work will be undertaken: summer, fall, or spring. Applications for a collaborative project will only be eligible for a single $5000 award to be distributed among project participants. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.

Generously supported by UVa Library, the DH Prototyping Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to provide students with the time necessary for the rapid development of digital projects and skills.

The call is typically issued annually in the spring.

**Eligibility, Conditions, and Requirements**

* Applicants must be MA or PhD students working in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.
*	Applicants must be enrolled as a UVA student during the academic year of the fellowship.
* Some digital humanities experience is encouraged but not required. This background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the Praxis Program,but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.

**How to Apply**

To apply, direct a letter of interest addressed to the selection committee containing:

* a summary of the proposed project, timeline, and outcome;
* a summary of the applicant’s experience with digital projects;
* a description of UVa library digital resources (content or expertise) that are relevant to the proposed project;
* and your availability on the date we identify for an interview (TBD). We’re aiming for a quick process this year by announcing the interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.

Complete applications as well as questions about fellowships or the application process should be directed to [Brandon Walsh](mailto:bmw9t@virginia.edu). Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write. Interested students are strongly encouraged to reach out to discuss their applications before applying.
