Last week I was in Little Rock, Arkansas for the Society for American Music conference, but Prism seemed to be following me:

This logo looks uncannily like one of our sketches for Prism highlighting. So far I can't find anything on the internet about this logo or what kind of company it might be for. It seems like it must be a paint or lighting company? In any case, I bet our use of this visual treatment of text is probably cooler. There's something very compelling about refraction as a metaphor for collective interpretation of text. The crowd is a prism that reveals facets of the text, and the text is a prism that reveals facets of the crowd. The rainbow splayed across the text is an apt image for Prism's aspirations for bringing text to life through accumulatedÂ interpretations.
