<!--
The text below is from the accessibility page, which links to this page for more info about directions etc.; wanted to include:
possible references to COVID precautions
maps
directions from nearest accessible parking and elevators
directions to nearest gendered/gender-neutral/family restrooms
directions to lactation room
physical accessibility of spaces
variance of noise level of spaces
if some of these already exist on other library-wide public pages we could link to those?

/accessibility text (don't need to duplicate it here?)

<h2>Physical accessbility</h2>

<h3>Illness</h3>
<p><a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/uva_drops_mandates_for_vaccines_indoor_masking">UVA does not currently require in classrooms or public spaces</a>, though these recomain recommended as an effective precautionary measure against spreading COVID-19, colds, flus, and other illnesses that can range from inconvenient to disabling or worse, especially for colleagues who are immunocompromised.</p>

<p>You can be contagious and not have any symptoms; home COVID tests are not 100% accurate. Please keep this in mind when we share space together. If you are feeling ill, we ask that you not attend events in our space; please [contact us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to request virtual consultation or event attendance options.</p>

<p>We have extra masks available for attendees of events in our space who want one.</p>

<h3>Mobility & distance</h3>
<p>Directions on accessing our space from the nearest parking and elevators; gendered, gender-neutral, and family restrooms; lactation room; as well as any intervening barriers to physical access, will appear on our <a href="/use-the-lab">"Use the Lab" page</a> soon.</p>

<p>Our new makerspace room (Shannon 308i) was designed with physical access in mind, and includes options like worktables that can be raised and lowered to wheelchair sitting and standing heights. Please contact <a href="/people/ammon-shepherd">Makerspace Manager Ammon Shepherd</a> if you have questions about physical makerspace access.</p>
