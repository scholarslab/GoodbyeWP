One of our primary missions is to support the work of emerging scholars and digital humanities practitioners--particularly UVa graduate students. In addition to our general consultations (grad students are invited to [write us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) for an appointment any time!), we offer three graduate fellowship programs that provide students with the time, space, and mentorship necessary to discover, explore, and build. We also offer a number of opportunities for students to gain training and experience as digital humanists. Check out our offerings below and get in touch if you have questions.

For expressions of the pedagogy we bring to our work with students, explore our [student programs charter](/student-programs-charter/), the [Praxis Program charter](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/praxis-program-charter/), and the [general Scholars' Lab charter](/charter/). To see the results of some of these collaborations, check out our [archive of student projects](/student-projects-archive).

## Digital Humanities Programming and Departmental Language Requirements

UVA departments determine language proficiency requirements for their students. Graduate students affiliated with the Scholars' Lab have at times obtained departmental approval to satisfy a component of their language proficiency requirements by demonstrating proficiency in a digital humanities programming language. If your faculty advisor and DGS endorse this concept based on the relevance of programming to your proposed research, please contact our Head of Student Programs to discuss our role in designing a proficiency exam that is appropriate for your research and meets the standards of your department.

## Professional Development
No deadline or formal call! Delivered on an ongoing, by-request basis.

Check out [our offerings](/professional-development/), [drop us a line](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu), and let us know how we can help.

## Archive of Past Opportunities
In addition to the above, active programs, the Scholars' Lab has participated in a range of programs with limited funding that have run their course. While these initiatives are no longer active, they can give a taste of the kinds of work we get up to. We will issue regular announcements and post application deadlines should funding become available.
