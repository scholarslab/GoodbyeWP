Over the past two years, with generous support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia Library has hosted an _Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship_. Today we're pleased to announce the launch of "Spatial Humanities," a community-driven resource for place-based digital scholarship:

[http://spatial.scholarslab.org/](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/)

This site responds to needs identified in conversation with our 21 Institute faculty members and 56 participants (humanities scholars, software developers, and map & GIS librarians).  It includes:



	
  * an evolving, crowdsourced catalog of research resources, projects, and organizations;

	
  * a set of framing essays on the spatial turn across the disciplines by Dr. Jo Guldi of the Harvard Society of Fellows;

	
  * GIS-related feeds from Q&A sites and other forms of social media;

	
  * and a peer-reviewed, occasional publication for step-by-step tutorials in spatial tools and methods.


Please help us keep this resource current by contributing to it! You can:

	
  * use Zotero to freely upload research citations, projects, and links to groups;

	
  * contribute your own tutorials and helpsheets in “Step By Step” format for peer review and formal publication;

	
  * adopt the #geoinst hashtag on Twitter and Delicious;

	
  * ask related questions and offer help on DH Answers or the GIS Stack Exchange;

	
  * and post your commentary on the essays we’ve shared.
