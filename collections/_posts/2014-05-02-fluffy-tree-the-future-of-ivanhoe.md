On Tuesday, we launched [Ivanhoe 1.0](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/). As [Scott](https://www.scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/dialogical-code-and-the-adventure-of-pair-programming/) noted yesterday, much of the PHP which drives our Ivanhoe Wordpress theme is the product of our many hours spent in the Scholars' Lab pair-programming.




Now that Ivanhoe 1.0 is out in the world, Scott and I have settled down to tackle the next feature: fluffy tree.

Fluffy tree will enable users to respond to multiple moves at once, thereby creating a broader network of connections within each game. The feature name arose from a conversation we and the Scholars' Lab developers had early in the semester about how to conceptualize the Ivanhoe game within the blog-based structure of WordPress - we didn't want a 'vine,' with one move linking to the next in a linear/hierarchical fashion, but a 'fluffy tree,' in which moves intertwined with one another in an organic fashion.




To write the code for fluffy tree, we have had to take a jumbled mess of potential connections and turn it into a clear, linear progression of events. This has required a lot of white-board time and adding JavaScript to our programming repertoire. While we do not yet have fluffy tree working, we have definitely figured out how to work on it - and really, knowing how to work collaboratively is a goal in itself.
