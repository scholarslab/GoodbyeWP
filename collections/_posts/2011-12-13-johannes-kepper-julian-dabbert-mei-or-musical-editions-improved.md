**MEI, or Musical Editions Improved**
On November 4th, the UVa Music Library and the Scholars' Lab welcomed Dr. Johannes Kepper, Entwicklung/Betreuung Kooperationspartner at the Edirom Project, and Mr. Julian Dabbert, Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter on Project TextGrid at the University of Paderborn.

Dr. Kepper and Mr. Debbert discussed the requirements, characteristics and benefits of digital editions based on the Music Encoding Initiative schema, as well as MEI-based applications such as the Edirom toolset and the MerMEId metadata editor. The whole group also discussed the impact of these technologies on scholarly editing in general.
