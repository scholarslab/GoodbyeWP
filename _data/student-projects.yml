  description: 'In observation of the [expansion of the public domain in 2019](https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/public-domain/), <i>Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning</i> examines how U.S. copyright law interacts with digital research and pedagogy. Working with Robert Frost’s New Hampshire (1923), the project presents a series of tutorials that demonstrate how to use a public domain work in order to empower our audience to understand, transform, and intervene in the range of material now available online.'

  description: '"Digital Skriker" explores both the theoretical cruxes and archival possibilities enabled by robust and increasingly accessible motion capture and virtual reality technologies using Caryl Churchill’s play, The Skriker (1994) as a case study. I’m interested not only in how these technologies might change the way we think about documenting stage movement and gesture, but also how they may enable new modes of performance, using "digital" space and nonhuman  actors as part of an immersive and/or site-specific theatre practice.'

  description: This dissertation project employs network analysis methods and technologies to examine the archaeological remains of domestic spaces in the Roman provinces of northwestern Europe. Using spatial statistics and a multiscalar application of network theory, the study explores the idea of a culturally-specific use of space, tracked through treating each archaeological context as a network, and then following changes over time that might speak to processes of assimilation and cultural adaptation as the frontier provinces of Europe were integrated more fully into the Roman socio-political sphere of influence. In addition to network anaylsis methods, the project also employs space syntax methods for looking at architectural arrangements, as well as ArcGIS for visualization and coding in R and Python for data analysis.

  description: "Julia's dissertation research investigates the ruins of a 19th century sugar estate, the material culture excavated from the laborers’ village on the plantation, and colonial archival records inside Bras d’Eau National park, Mauritius. During her DH fellowship, she focused on reworking the data she had collected, including maps of archaeological ruins, sketches from excavations and of artifacts collected, and extensive artifact catalogues. Recreating the material world through digital mediums such as ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator and 3D printing allowed her to better understand how the daily activities of indentured women, men, and children shaped the cultural and environmental landscape in colonial Mauritius and fit more broadly in Indian Ocean World networks."

  description: "In support of his dissertation on the interconnected development of civilian encryption technology and digital privacy rights, Shane's fellowship project analyzes Usenet conversations about cryptography and privacy between 1981 and 2000. Usenet was an early digital communications network, a key precursor to Web discussion forums and later online communities and social networks. In its heyday, it offered a genuinely vast sampling of public, potentially pseudonymous discussion organized neatly into hierarchies of \"newsgroups\" as diverse as alt.sex, rec.drugs, and alt.rock-n-roll. Over the course of his Digital Humanities Fellowship, Shane has written a set of software tools to scrape and process the raw data from select newsgroups, discover adjacent groups and key figures of influence, and map the flow of ideas and networks of interaction across domains and time."

  description: This mapping and data visualization project traces the role of publishers and printers in Jorge Luis Borges’s Argentina (1930-1951) and provides a digital archive of records of the physical features of books from this moment and time in history. This project has two distinct elements. The first is an interactive map of the locations of Borges's publisher, printers, booksellers, and places of employment from 1930 to 1951. The second part of the project is a descriptive bibliography, or a description of the physical elements of the books that Borges wrote, prologued, translated, or edited during the 1930s and 1940s.

  description: The Age of Lead examines the relationship between metropolitan development and lead poisoning in Baltimore from the late-nineteenth century to the late-twentieth century. In particular, I trace how concerns about environmental health in the city fostered the desire for suburban living, but how suburbanization deepened and even caused disparities in lead hazards between the suburbs and the inner city. His dissertation won the 2017 Council of Graduate Schools/ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award in the Humanities and Fine Arts, and we helped him process and visualize his map data.

  description: "Community Listening in Isle Royale National Park traces how I became part of a dialogue among a team of wolf biologists and a community of park-explorers who share a unique deep listening relationship. The scientists involved in this project are the primary investigators in the five-decade long wolf/moose project, the longest continuous wildlife study in the world. The primary way these researchers determine clues of wolf reproduction is to listen for the sounds of group howling during the summer months when excitement at den sites erupts during pup feeding time. The ethnographic composition weaves together several different types of sound data collected during fieldwork: soundscape recordings of the place, interviews with the wolf/moose researchers, interviews with park visitors and employees, audio diaries, an audio essay derived from field notes, and archival recordings."

Think of it as collaborative fan fiction meets exegesis - by playing out the roles of characters in new ways, Ivanhoe asks users to make interventions."

Assembling and topic modeling a vast archive of twitter data and episode transcripts, the cohort produced a lengthy digital essay that sits at the intersections of media studies, digital humanities, and public humanities."

More specifically, Augmenting the University integrates documents from UVA’s special collections library with physical spaces around grounds. Ultimately, we hope to use AR to allow users to experience these limited-access spaces and objects in new ways that prompt critical reflection on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university."
