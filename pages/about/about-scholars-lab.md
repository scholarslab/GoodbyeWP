## What we are: mission & vision

**Experiment in community.** The Scholars' Lab is an interdisciplinary research lab for critical, creative, and just explorations of the intersections of technology and culture. 
We believe advancing social justice is both a key responsibility and opportunity of all scholarship. Digital and experimental scholarship offer particular possibilities for pursuing justice and care. In our work, we strive to create opportunities for inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility, including through attention (both learning and teaching) to unequal power dynamics, racism, sexism, ableism, transphobia, and other forms of oppression that limit both justice and knowledge-building. We capture the Scholars' Lab's values and goals in our team-authored [charter](/charter).

**People & community.** We offer students, faculty, staff, and local community members consultation and collaboration, teaching and training, and supportive spaces for anyone curious about pushing scholarly boundaries through creative, computational research practices.

Our "people over projects" motto means our mission is creating and empowering colleagues as capable digital scholarly practitioners in their own rights; and our most important outcome has been cultivating just, caring, and inspiring scholarly community in support of that mission.

We are foremost a space for learning together—about anything—by trying stuff. Think of us as friends and colleagues who can help you teach yourself new ways of approaching your interests. We'd love you to be part of our community!

**Our work.** While much of our work investigates cultural and humanities questions, we are open to everyone and routinely bring our skillsets to all areas of interdisciplinary research and teaching, broadly defined. Our staff offer deep expertise in digital humanities, computer and information science, spatial technologies, maker, and cultural heritage approaches. 

We foster technology-driven research interventions; critical modes of data and algorithmic inquiry; and the ethical design, development, and uses of digital tools and methods. We prioritize public scholarship, healthy collaboration, and accurate credit for all participants. 

Our staff maintain ongoing research activity and external professional and scholarly engagement, increasing our familiarity with the latest tools and methods, and informing future Scholars' Lab services. Our leadership in international scholarly and professional organizations and communities lets us connect UVA colleagues to the forefront of digital and experimental scholarship, new collaborators, and exciting opportunities.

**Our history.** Since 2006, the Scholars' Lab has served as the UVA Library’s interdisciplinary digital humanities research center. In 2023, our colleagues in the longstanding Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) moved into the Library, joining us as allied institutions within the umbrella of the Library's Digital Humanities Center.

## What we are not
We strongly believe investment in the direct practice of experimental methods is the key to transformative experiences for individual scholars, as well as the best leveraging of our resources on behalf of UVA. Therefore, we do not provide general design, web development, or technical services. We spend the majority of our time teaching people to build and practice digital scholarship themselves, and building things with people (e.g. as peer scholars, co-PIs on grant proposals), rather than building things for people (e.g. as a service, for hire).

## Who are the scholars in "Scholars' Lab"?
Everyone! We define scholarship as one part critical thinking plus one part communicating the results of that thinking. Critical thinking can be accomplished through many methods, including research, writing, coding, building, designing, experimenting, and play. Communicating critical thinking can take the form of traditional publishing or other forms of “making public” such as tweeting and blogging, teaching, sharing open source code, or any other way for your intellectual community to learn from, critique, evaluate, and/or build on your work. When we refer to scholars, that includes anyone critically engaging with a concept: students, staff, faculty, and community members. On our website, the page that often gets titled "Projects" or "Research" or "Scholarship" on similar websites is titled "Our Work", to better reflect that our scholarship covers a broad variety of work.

Check out our [people](/people/) page for current staff, students, and alums.

## How does the Lab fit into the UVA Library?
The Scholars' Lab research center was founded in 2006. We’re part of <a href="http://library.virginia.edu">the UVA Library</a> and its mission to provide equitable access to knowledge and learning to everyone. Organizationally, we sit in the Library's Research & Learning Services unit led by Mira Waller, and the Library's Digital Humanities Center (created as an umbrella partnering us with frequent DH expert co-conspirators IATH). 

We frequently collaborate with our Library colleagues, including Preservation, Special Collections, Teaching & Learning, and subject liaison librarians. Some of these folks don't work directly with students, staff, or faculty outside the Library, but they're critical to everything we do. These colleagues include the Library's facilitates teams maintaining and securing our spaces, assisting with events logistics, and IT and UX support. Dave Hennigan helps us design and manage grant-supported scholarship.

We're also grateful for the frequent collaborators with us in the Library's Research Learning Services unit (Information Spaces & Services, Teaching & Learning, subject liaisons, and Research Data Services teams).

## How was this website made?
This website contains the collective effort of our [staff and collaborators](/people), past and present. The website has existed in multiple forms: as a WordPress site (?-2018); as a Jekyll-generated static website (2018-current), and same platform but with its latest theming (2024-current).

**The 2024 renewal of this website** incorporates the past work of many SLab staff, students, and community members, with new work by Amanda Visconti, Jeremy Boggs, and Laura Miller.

**The 2017-2018 renewal of this website** incorporates text, suggestions, and feedback from everyone on [the Scholars' Lab staff](/people). Additionally, the following folks put in significant extra effort on the site's design, coding, content, project management, and documentation: Katherine Donnally, Jeremy Boggs, Brandon Walsh, Ronda Grizzle, Laura Miller, Zoe LeBlanc, Ammon Shepherd, Shane Lin, Beth Mitchell, and Amanda Visconti. Check out our [site relaunch blog post](/blog/site-relaunch) for more information on how and why we moved our site from WordPress to its current Jekyll form.
