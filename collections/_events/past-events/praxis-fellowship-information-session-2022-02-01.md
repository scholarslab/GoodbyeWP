Praxis Applications are due soon! See the official CFP for more details about the fellowship [itself](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/apply-to-the-praxis-program-in-2022-2023/). If you have questions about the Scholars' Lab's year-long, soup-to-nuts introduction to Digital Humanities please attend this information session to be held February 1st, 2022 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please [register](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/PraxisProgramInfo2023) to attend. If you're interested in discussing your application earlier or individually, we highly encourage students to write to [Brandon Walsh](mailto:bmw9t@virginia.edu). Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.
