Will Rourk's fall term 3D cultural heritage informatics students will present their final work, based on fieldwork at regional sites. Presentations will run 1-2pm, followed by exploring the work in our VR corner from 2-3pm. (You can come for just part of the event, if your schedule requires; the 2-2:30 piece will be informally experiencing the VR work using our headsets.)
