<p>As our Scholars&#39; Lab <a href="/charter/">charter</a> indicates, we are committed to making our projects and spaces accessible&mdash;in all meanings of that word&mdash;for everyone, regardless of ability or need. We believe accessibility is not an implementation that can be finished and done, but rather a way of thinking and working that can&mdash;and should&mdash;always be improved.</p>

<h2>Web accessibility</h2>
<p>In terms of web accessibility, we strive to make our the built environment of the Scholars&#39; Lab website and social media pleasant, easy to access, and <a href="http://www.ada.gov/">ADA-compliant</a>.

<p>For this website, we follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">WCAG 2.0</a> and <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> guidelines. Our markup and presentation adhere to W3G&#39;s standards for HTML5 and CSS3, and in doing so include many features meant to enhance the accessibility of our site, including:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>Correct ordering of headings to aid in navigation;</li>
<li>Alternative text for media where appropriate;</li>
<li>A skip link at the beginning of each page to jump to the page's main content;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles">ARIA roles</a> to better describe the purpose and content of various parts of our pages;</li>
<li>Alt text for images</li>
</ul>

<p>We use several tools to assess accessibility on our site, including the <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">Wave evaluation tool</a> by <a href="http://webaim.org">WebAIM</a> and <a href="http://pa11y.org/">Pa11y command line interface tool</a> by <a href="https://github.com/nature">Nature Publishing Group</a>.</p>

<p>We strive to follow similar practices on all our websites and when consulting and teaching about web design, aiming not for the legal minimum but for the best experience for all. For example, accessible and universal design are major components of our <a href="/praxis-program-fellowships">Praxis Program</a>'s <a href="https://designlab.jeremyboggs.net/">DesignLab</a> semester-long course, taught annually by <a href="/people/jeremy-boggs">Head of R&D Jeremy Boggs</a>.</p>

<p>On our social media, we strive to always use good descriptive alt text on images.</p>

<h2>Physical accessibility</h2>

<h3>Illness</h3>
If you have questions about or anticipate any issues with full access of our space and services, please <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">contact us</a> so we can help. We appreciate knowing where we can make improvements to increase our accessibility. Letting us know also allows us to put stories and numbers in support of accessibility improvements the university is aware are needed, but which don't yet have funding and/or are farther down the queue than other projects.

<p><a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/uva_drops_mandates_for_vaccines_indoor_masking">UVA does not currently require in classrooms or public spaces</a>, though these recomain recommended as an effective precautionary measure against spreading COVID-19, colds, flus, and other illnesses that can range from inconvenient to disabling or worse, especially for colleagues who are immunocompromised.</p>

<p>You can be contagious and not have any symptoms; home COVID tests are not 100% accurate. Please keep this in mind when we share space together. If you are feeling ill, we ask that you not attend events in our space; please <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">contact us</a> to request virtual consultation or event attendance options.</p>

<p>We have extra masks available for attendees of events in our space who want one.</p>

<h3>Mobility, distance, & space use</h3>
<p>Directions on accessing our space are available on our <a href="/use-the-lab">"Use the Lab" page</a>.</p>

<p>Our new makerspace room (Shannon 308i) was designed with physical access in mind, and includes options like worktables that can be raised and lowered to wheelchair sitting and standing heights. Please contact <a href="/people/ammon-shepherd">Makerspace Manager Ammon Shepherd</a> if you have questions about physical makerspace access.</p>

Some doors in the Shannon Library building do not currently offer push-button door-openers. These include several of our public doors, most of which we prop open during work hours (makerspace, consultation room, both entrances, grad office, doors between Text Aisle and Common Room). The door into our staff workroom space, behind which are several staff offices and our grad office, doesn't have a door-opener button and cannot be left propped open (due to the interior containing non-public space).
