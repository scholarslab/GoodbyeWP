No registration, just show up!

*January 23rd*  

**Introduction to ArcGIS Pro**  

Here’s your chance to get started with geographic information systems software in a friendly, jargon-free environment.  This workshop introduces the skills you need to make your own maps.  Along the way, you’ll get a taste of the latest software suite from Earth’s most popular GIS company and a gentle introduction to cartography. You’ll leave with your own cartographic masterpieces and tips for learning more in your pursuit of mappiness.

*January 30th*  

**Georeferencing a Map: Putting Old maps and Aerial Photos on Your Map (ArcGIS Pro)**  

Would you like to see historic map overlaid on modern aerial photography?  Do you need to extract features of a map for use in GIS?  Georeferencing is the first step.  We will show you how to take a scan of a paper map and align in it in ArcGIS.

*February 6th*  

**Getting Street Address on a Map (ArcGIS Pro)**  

Do you have a list of street addresses crying out to be mapped?  Have a list of zip codes or census tracts you wish to associate with other data?  We’ll start with addresses and other things spatial and end with points on a map, ready for visualization and analysis.  

*February 13th*  

**Creating and Editing Spatial Data (ArcGIS Pro)**  

Until we perfect that magic “extract all those lines from this paper map” button we’re stuck using editor tools to get that job done.  If you’re lucky, someone else has done the work to create your points, lines, and polygons but maybe they need your magic touch to make them better.  This session shows you how to create and modify vector features in ArcGIS Pro.  We’ll explore tools to create new points, lines, and polygons and to edit existing datasets. 

*February 20th*  

**Introduction to ArcGIS Online**  

With ArcGIS Online, you can use and create maps and scenes, access ready-to-use maps, layers and analytics, publish data as web layers, collaborate and share, access maps from any device, make maps with your Microsoft Excel data, and customize the ArcGIS Online website.

*February 27th*  

**Using ArcGIS Online Story Maps**  

Story Maps are templates that allow authors to give context to their ArcGIS Online maps.  Whether telling a story, giving a tour or comparing historic maps, Esri Story Maps are easy-to-use applications that create polished presentations.

*March 6th*  

**Using ArcGIS Online Data Collection Tools**  

Whether you are crowd sourcing spatial data or performing survey work, having applications that automatically record location and upload data directly to a mapping application is incredibly useful.  

*March 20th*  

**Using ArcGIS Online Web AppBuilder**  

Would you like to make a custom online mapping application without have to code?  Us too.  ArcGIS Web AppBuilder allows developers to use drag and drop tools to create responsive mapping applications.
