"The Fast and the Curious" is a ten-part lecture series for the 2024-2025 academic year that will feature the *Fast and Furious* franchise. Although *Fast and Furious* is popular and commercially successful, it has also had a fascinating impact on car culture, automotive design and technology, and features significant representation of Black, Latine, and Asian communities.  

This session will feature MC Forelle (Engineering) and Kenneth Brown (Mechanical Engineering) discussing the technology of the Fast and Furious focusing on NOS systems that feature prominently in the first film. After the talk, we'll screen the first film in the franchise, *The Fast and the Furious*.  

Snacks provided, but [registration required beforehand](https://bit.ly/fastandthecurious) as seating will be limited.

We're delighted to co-sponsor this event with Professor MC Forelle and UVA Engineering, the Virginia Motorsports Education club (a student org in the School of Engineering), and [UVA Library Science and Engineering Research Librarian Maggie Nunley](https://library.virginia.edu/staff/mn3fa).
