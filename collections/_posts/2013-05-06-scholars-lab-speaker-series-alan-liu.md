**Scholars' Lab Speaker Series: Alan Liu**
**4Humanities: Values, Strategies, Technologies for Humanities Advocacy in the Digital Age**

In April, Dr. Alan Liu, Professor in the Department of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, spoke about ways in which the skills and resources of the DH community can help advocate for the humanities.



Summary:
Alan Liu will present an informal talk exploring such issues as assessing values and narrative frames for communicating the worth of the humanities. He will also brainstorm next-generation methods for using digital/networked technologies to create material for public view of scholars' normal research and teaching work.
