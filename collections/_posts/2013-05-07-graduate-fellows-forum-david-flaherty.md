Summary:
The British Board of Trade, a bureaucratic body responsible for overseeing the 18th-century Atlantic colonies, had a broad geographic vision of the British Atlantic based on their extensive communication with colonies from Newfoundland to Honduras.  This project maps the Board's correspondence for a single year, showing which points on the map it received information about and where those letters came from, in an attempt to illustrate that vision.
