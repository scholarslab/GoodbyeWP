Recently introduced, the new StoryMaps sheds the complication of multiple templates in favor of a single builder that promises to replace all the functionality of the old templates. One template to rule them all! Come see what the future of Story Maps looks like. 

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Clemons Electronic Classroom, CLEM 407** (take a left as soon as you enter Clemons, the room is sort of behind the reference desk) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. No registration, just show up!
