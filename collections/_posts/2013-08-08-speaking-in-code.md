We're pleased to announce that applications are open for a 2-day, [NEH-funded](http://neh.gov) symposium and summit to be held at the Scholars' Lab this November 4th and 5th.

[![Speaking in Code](http://static.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-shot-2013-08-08-at-10.35.09-AM.png)](http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/)

"[Speaking in Code](http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/)" will bring together a small cohort of accomplished digital humanities software developers. Together, we will give voice to what is almost always tacitly expressed in DH development work: expert knowledge about the intellectual and interpretive dimensions of code-craft, and unspoken understandings about the relation of our labor and its products to ethics, scholarly method, and humanities theory.

Over the course of two days, participants will:



	
  * reflect on and express, from developers' own points of view, what is particular to the humanities and of scholarly significance in DH software development products and practices;

	
  * and collaboratively devise an action-oriented agenda to bridge the gaps in critical vocabulary and discourse norms that can frequently distance creators of humanities platforms or tools from the scholars who use and critique them.


In addition to [Scholars' Lab](https://www.scholarslab.org/people/) developers and project managers, facilitators include [Steve Ramsay](http://stephenramsay.us/), [Bill Turkel](http://williamjturkel.net/), [Stéfan Sinclair](http://stefansinclair.name/), [Hugh Cayless](http://philomousos.blogspot.com/), and [Tim Sherratt](http://discontents.com.au/).  The SLab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of developers who are women, people of color, LGBTQ, or from other under-represented groups. (See "[You Are Welcome Here](http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#inclusivity)" for more info.)

This will be the first focused meeting to address the implications of tacit knowledge exchange in digital humanities software development. Check out the Speaking in Code website [to apply](http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/)! Deadline September 12th.
