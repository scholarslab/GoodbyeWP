So the other day I spent most of my day working through the CSS on the Prism site.  It was incredibly annoying at first but at some point I really hit my stride and started to get it.  In order to start just figuring out where everything was located I made a feature branch (appropriately titled Honey Boo Boo) and started playing around until I could get it close to what I wanted it to look like.  I succeeded (as you can see above) in getting the homepage to look like what I imagined.  Currently I am using three of my femme superheroes as placeholders for the buttons (for those of you who don't know they are [from left to right] Honey Boo Boo, Nicki Minaj, and RuPaul).  So this is a rough sketch of what the homepage might look like, although we will probably tone down the fabulosity that is the current buttons.  Thoughts?  Feedback?
