Is “location analytics” just a catchy buzzphrase? Probably, but while trendy terminology comes and goes, understanding your data is timeless. We’ll delve into this data analytics tool that allows you to explore your data, spatial and non-spatial, in an interactive workspace. 

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 1PM to 2PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration is open until 1 hour before class.
