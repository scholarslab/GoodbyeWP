[Claudia Berger](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mugs6lkjuqadjskl6bw2lc4r) maintains a [Zotero "physical data viz" group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4985065/physical_data_vis) containing nearly 100 articles, datasets, and other relevant reads. 

I added several items to that library this past week, and wanted to capture [my Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/literaturegeek.bsky.social) thread about them for the blog:
 
## Personal stress data as commentary on stress-impacted health issues
Laurie Frick's ["Stress Inventory"](https://www.lauriefrick.com/stress-inventory) uses leather discs on stretched linen, piled and colored to record daily irritation levels & highlight stress' contribution to chronic health issues. (HT [Laura Miller](https://bsky.app/profile/lmmiller.bsky.social))

## Weaving data analysis of speculative fiction 
[Quinn Dombrowski's](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2cg2jbl3sdsoqa5bqlc44ckv) ["The Locked Loom 1: Gideon the Ninth"](https://quinndombrowski.com/blog/2023/12/21/locked-loom-1-gideon-the-ninth/) discusses a weaving text visualization and analysis based on elements of everyone's favorite "lesbian necromancers in space" fantasy novel (the _Locked Tomb Series_; highly recommend, it is not silly/pulp despite that being a fitting descriptor, but rather epic, page-turning speculative fiction/sci fi).

## Baking data-displaying cakes for climate change advocacy
An interview with "baker-turned-glacier guide" Rose Mcadoo on her ["Cakes for Climate Change"](https://thisismold.com/profile/cakes-for-climate-change#nl-2) combating climate demise through educational cakes and desserts that explain the natural processes behind glaciology and climate change.

## Workflow for turning ambient audio data into 3D prints
Audrey Desjardins' and Timea Tihanyi's ["ListeningCups: A Case of Data Tactility & Data Stories"](http://audreydesjardins.com/pdf/Desjardins-ListeningCups-DIS2019.pdf) documents a workflow for capturing data, creating 3D printed porcelain cups embedded with datasets of everyday ambient sounds; and shares reflections around experiences such as "data accidents" (HT [Beth Mitchell](https://bsky.app/profile/bethmitchell.bsky.social))

## Reflections from installing a data physicalization exhibit
[Claudia Berger](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mugs6lkjuqadjskl6bw2lc4r) and Chris Alen Sula's [piece on lessons learned from installing a data physicalization](https://nightingaledvs.com/lessons-from-installing-a-data-physicalization/) of a HASTAC conference's metadata, published in _Nightingale_ (the journal of the Data Visualization Society).

## Building data intended for (sometimes physical) art
["Datasets as Imagination"](https://joinreboot.org/p/artist-datasets) by Lisa Shroff argues for collectively built datasets shaped specifically for reuse by artists for art, including for physical data exhibits. (HT Zoe LeBlanc)

## Library research guide for data physicalization
["Data Driven Creativity: Making Data Physicalizations"](https://libguides.princeton.edu/c.php?g=1370278&p=10125539) is a library guide by Ariel Ackerly, Sarah Reiff Conell, and Ofira Schwartz, gathering datasets, projects, and writing about data physicalizations.

_("HT" is shorthand for "hat tip", a minimal-characters way people say "I found this link via this other person sharing it in the past; thanks to them".)_
