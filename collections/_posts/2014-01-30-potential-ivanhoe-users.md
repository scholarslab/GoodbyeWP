Attention, game players and digital-pedagogy enthusiasts!

This year's [Praxis Program](https://praxis.scholarslab.org/) is rebooting SpecLab's [Ivanhoe Game](http://www.ivanhoegame.org/?page_id=21) as a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) [theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/) that users can install on their own websites and style and configure according to their individual needs.

We would greatly appreciate feedback on the ways potential users already employ WordPress in their course websites or personal homepages.Â  If you are interested in installing Ivanhoe and hosting games for students or friends, please help us by answering a few questions.



Thank you!
