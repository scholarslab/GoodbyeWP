Recognizing the significance of events on the weekend of August 12, the University of Virginia Library is building an archive of materials surrounding the “Unite the Right” rally and counter-protests.

The Library is interested in personal digital submissions (including images, stories, audio, or video) from the events at UVA and in the Charlottesville area, so that they may make these materials available to students and researchers studying these events. Donors have the option to keep their name private if they wish.
