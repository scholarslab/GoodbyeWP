Every semester Kelly Johnston and I teach a workshop series around specific topics in GIS.   Typically, we stick to the basics for fall but branch out and mix it up a little by teaching new topics in spring.  Our sessions are one hour long and generally designed to be hands-on and don't require prior knowledge to participate.  Preregistration is not required. All sessions are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.

Please find a PDF of the below schedule [here](http://static.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/spring13GISworkshops.pdf).

Neatline is a set of plugins for Omeka developed by the Scholars’ Lab. With this tool, anyone can create
beautiful, complex maps and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, and to connect
maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. See
http://neatline.org/ for more information.

**Making Cartograms**

Campbell Hall, Room 105

Session repeats on
Thursday, February 28
3:00 – 4:00pm

A cartogram is a thematic map that uses area to represent something other than area. Imagine a map where
country area represents population, or cancer rates. You will learn how to send a powerful message with this
thematic technique.

**Introduction to GDAL**

4:00 – 5:00pm
Campbell Hall, Room 105

Session repeats on
Thursday, March 7
3:00 – 4:00pm

The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library is an open source utility library for raster geospatial data formats. As
a library, it presents a large number of utilities to the calling application for all supported formats. It also
comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing. We will focus on the
command line utilities.

**Do It Yourself Aerials**

Wednesday, March 20
4:00 – 5:00pm
Campbell Hall, Room 105

Session repeats on
Thursday, March 21

Alderman Library, Room 421 (Electronic Classroom)

We have three aerial platforms, balloon, kite and hexcopter. Come get an update from us and find out how to
do your own aerial photography.

**Introduction to Quantum GIS**

Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an open source, multi-platform GIS. While not nearly as powerful as ArcGIS, the
80/20 rule applies. Probably 80% of the things most users want to do with GIS can be done with QGIS. The
session will introduce the interface and participants will make some nice maps. Learn more about QGIS at
http://www.qgis.org.

**Advanced Techniques with Quantum GIS**

Wednesday, April 3
4:00 – 5:00pm
Campbell Hall, Room 105

Session repeats on
Thursday, April 4
3:00 – 4:00pm
Alderman Library, Room 421 (Electronic Classroom)

One of QGIS’s strengths is its ability to pull in various streaming open standard data services. We will pull
some data in from a remote location and do some spatial analysis.
