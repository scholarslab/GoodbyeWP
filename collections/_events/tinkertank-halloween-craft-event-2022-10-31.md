Come to the Scholarsâ€™ Lab TinkerTank the week before Halloween, and on Halloween Day to create a light up craft.

Or use our button makers, sewing machines, CNC paper cutter, and electronics to make Halloween costumes, decorations and decor.

Stop by Monday through Friday, any time between noon and 7pm to make a 5 minute light up paper electronics craft!

All supplied included. All for free!

We are located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor.
