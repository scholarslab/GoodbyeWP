Spring is springing, which means we'll be shifting our workshop focus from ArcGIS Pro to ArcGIS Online (AGOL), Esri's GIS solution for the cloud. AGOL is browser-based, eliminating any Windows vs. Mac shenanigans, and allowing us to provide temporary access to members of the community that don't have UVA credentials. 

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 11AM to 12PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration will remain open until the conclusion of the workshop. Use the links below to register and get a Zoom link.

**February 15th - Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online**

ArcGIS Online provides a select set of the most common analysis tools, all from the convenience of your browser. Perform basic analysis with tools like Buffer and Spatial Join. Or, enhance your data, taking advantage of the always up-to-date elevation, streets, and demographics data available in ArcGIS Online with tools like Create Viewshed, Find Nearest, and Enrich. Come to learn and stay for stories about the old days when we had to create all that data ourselves. Uphill. Both ways!!
