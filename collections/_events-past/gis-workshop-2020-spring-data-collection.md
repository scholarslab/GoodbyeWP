# Update 3/11/2019 - Workshop Cancelled #
**Following the University's decision to move all classes online, this workshop session has been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience. If you'd like to discuss Survey123 and data collection, please contact us at** [uvagis@virginia.edu](mailto:uvagis@virginia.edu).

Whether you are crowd sourcing spatial data or performing survey work, having applications that automatically record location and upload data directly to a mapping application is incredibly useful.   

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Clemons Electronic Classroom, CLEM 407** (take a left as soon as you enter Clemons, the room is sort of behind the reference desk) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. No registration, just show up!
