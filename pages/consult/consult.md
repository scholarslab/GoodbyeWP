The easiest way to get started is to send an email to [ScholarsLab@Virginia.edu](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu) to tell us what you're interested in, and the appropriate staff will work with you to schedule an in-person or Zoom consultation. 

## Set up a consultation
The more you can tell us, the better we can have the right experts in the room and prepareâ€”but if all you know if "I want to know more about the digital humanities" (or spatial technologies, making, DH code and design, or DH pedagogy) that's okay too! There's no bar to chat with our friendly staff and start exploring digital or experimental approaches to your research, teaching, or learning.

## Interdisciplinary areas of expertise
While much of our work investigates cultural and humanities questions, we are open to everyone and routinely bring our skillsets to all areas of interdisciplinary research and teaching, broadly defined. Our staff offer deep expertise in digital humanities, computer and information science, spatial technologies, maker, and cultural heritage approaches.
