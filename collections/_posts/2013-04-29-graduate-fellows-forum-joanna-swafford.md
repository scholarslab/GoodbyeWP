**Graduate Fellows Forum: Joanna Swafford**
**Victorian Songs and Digital Tools: Facilitating Sound Studies Scholarship**

Joanna Swafford
PhD Candidate, Department of English
Scholars' Lab Fellow 2012-2013

Respondent
Dr. Herbert Tucker
John C. Coleman Professor of English
University of Virginia

Summary:
Although sound studies and interdisciplinary music and poetry scholarship have increased over the last decade, scholars have not had the digital tools necessary to make their auditory arguments accessible to a wider audience. This talk will present two tools built by Scholars' Lab Fellow Joanna Swafford that will help change that: _Songs of the Victorians_, an archive and analysis of parlor and art song settings of Victorian poems, and _Augmented Notes_, a tool that will let scholars build their own interdisciplinary websites like _Songs of the Victorians_.
