Come celebrate **international GIS Day** with the Scholars' Lab! This virtual event will be a one hour session of short presentations from local researchers across a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately, we can’t provide a GIS Day cake this year, but feel free to enjoy your own sweet treats (map-themed, of course, if you’re feeling ambitious)!
 
All UVa and Charlottesville-area community members are welcome to attend. [Registration](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/GISDay2020) is open and remains open until 1 hour before the event.
 
Please help us spread the word! We hope you can join us on Nov 18th!
