We're part of the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/">UVA Library</a>'s mission to provide equitable access to learning to everyone, and we're proud that librarian superpowers are part of our toolkit! SLab supports the Library's mission by nurturing an innovative, collaborative culture of research and development on Grounds.

We frequently collaborate with and rely on our colleagues throughout our Library. Some of these folks don't work directly with students, staff, or faculty outside the Library, but they're critical to everything we do. These colleagues include the Library's facilitates teams maintaining and securing our spaces, assisting with events logistics, and IT and UX support. Dave Hennigan helps us design and manage grant-supported scholarship.

We're also grateful for the frequent collaborators with us in the Library's Research Learning Services unit (Information Spaces & Services, Teaching & Learning, subject liaisons, and Research Data Services teams).
