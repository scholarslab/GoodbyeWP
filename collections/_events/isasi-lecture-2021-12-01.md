**Your Text Analysis is Fantastic!, but I Can’t Replicate it en español**
 
While we understand that the digital humanities are now practiced globally, we also know that the playground is not level due to several factors. One of them, the language barrier, has been a lesser spoken about issue in our context in the US/North while practitioners outside the anglophone world have been screaming about it for years, as their research has continued to be seen as simplistic and disregarded from scholarly venues.
 
It is now apparent that efforts to undo said barrier are gaining traction with more multilingual DH initiatives and journals calling for non-English participation. But decentering English as the language of learning and knowledge production in DH poses many challenges and questions. Using several specific cases of teaching materials from *Programming Historian en español*, Isasi will focus on pedagogy and make the case for carefully created multilingual DH ecosystems, with learning scenarios that have the specifics of a community, language, culture and resources in mind.

**This program is open to all, but registration is required. The Zoom link to join will be sent via email before the event.**

Dr. Jennifer Isasi is the Director of the Digital Liberal Arts Research Initiative at the Pennsylvania State University, and an editor on the *Programming Historian en español* journal. Prior to her position at PSU, she was a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation in Latin American and Latino/a Studies at the University of Texas Libraries. Isasi holds a Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies with a specialization in Digital Humanities from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA.
