November 17th is International GIS Day, and we'd love for you to join us in this celebration of all things spatial. We always enjoy getting together to see your amazing GIS work and enjoy a delicious piece of cake, but due to...well, you know, we're going to do things a little differently this year. In lieu of presentations and cake, we're holding a virtual kickoff event for our Community Mapping Project, where we're asking you to help us collect the locations of public art projects and installations in and around Charlottesville. 

Please [Register Here](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/GISDay2021) to attend the virtual kickoff event!
