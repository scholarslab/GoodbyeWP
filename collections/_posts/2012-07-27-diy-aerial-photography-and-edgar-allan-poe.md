Earlier this year Professor [Megan Marlatt](http://www.virginia.edu/art/studio/faculty/marlatt.html) from the University of Virginia McIntire Department of Art began work with her students to create a jumbo outdoor mural titled ["Hello Pluto, Good-bye Kitty"](http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=17953) based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story "[The Black Cat](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=PoeBlac.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=1&division=div1)".   The mural design covered a large suburban parking lot.

From street level, viewers see small cats painted on the parking lot.

But when we gain the larger view by lofting a camera attached to a helium balloon several hundred feet into the air we get our first views of the entire work in progress.

"'Hello Pluto, Good-bye Kitty" was off to a fine start but much work was still to be done.[![Mural Under Construction](http://static.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/6976147874_138445fffa_b.jpg)](https://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/update-diy-aerial-photography/attachment/6976147874_138445fffa_b/)

When Professor Marlatt and her students completed their work a few weeks later we returned with our [aerial photography rig](https://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/diy-aerial-photography-in-a-crowd/) to document the finished product.[![](http://static.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/GOPR1610-1024x768.jpg)](https://scholarslab.org/geospatial-and-temporal/diy-aerial-photography-and-edgar-allan-poe/attachment/dcim100gopro-11/)

This project illustrates some of the benefits of do it yourself aerial photography.  With a small investment of equipment and time we collected high resolution imagery to document change over time for a discrete study area. We see applications for these techniques across many academic disciplines.  So we're working now to fine-tune our approaches while we collaborate with faculty and students.

Contact us in the [Scholars' Lab](https://scholarslab.org/about/) to chat about how your work can benefit from do it yourself aerial photography.
