Wayne asked us newbies to solve the Fizz Buzz problem for homework. [Here](https://github.com/egnally/Ruby/blob/master/homework.rb) is my solution. I got stuck at the start, where I couldn't remember how to make anything print--let alone all the numbers between 1 and 100. I also got stuck on how and where to introduce the iterative step. I find the way computers "count" to be quite confusing. Then, I wrote a program that ran indefinitely because I had the iterative step in the wrong spot. It hadn't occurred to me that computers read programs in order.

This exercise took me back to learning how to solve word problems in grade school.  The most difficult part is to figure out what is being asked and which tools are appropriate.
