November 17th is International GIS Day, and we'd love for you to join us in this celebration of all things spatial. We always look forward to getting together to see and discuss your amazing GIS work while enjoying a delicious piece of cake, but due to - well, you know - we're going to do things a little differently this year. In lieu of presentations and cake, we're holding a virtual kickoff event for our Community Mapping Project, where we're asking you to help us collect the locations of public art projects and installations in and around Charlottesville. All you need is a mobile phone with a current browser to participate.

We are hosting our kickoff Zoom session at 2pm on November 17 for all volunteer mappers. Please [Register Here](https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/events/GISDay2021) to attend the virtual kickoff event!

Can’t make the event? Don’t worry! Keep scrolling, or [Click Here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b13bbb931c77455aaa51d256f1740d56), for more information, including a link to the public art location survey and a live view of already collected locations.

# Tips

Feel free to create entries for locations already entered. We will figure out a way to share all the unique views of each object. FYI, results map may take a few minutes to refresh showing new entries.

You can take the survey offline using the Survey123 app to avoid any data charges. Once installed, the app will download all the map information to your phone. Then when you get back to WiFi, you can upload your entries. However, data use is low.
