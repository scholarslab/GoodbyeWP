The design team got together again this week and we have mocked up a map of how the site will proceed.  Those who are interested can see it here: [prismmap](http://static.scholarslab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/prismmap.pdf)

There are quite a few new pages that we are adding so we hope this map will make it easier to see how the progression works.  As we conference with Shane and other folks we may have to reorganize some of the order but I think this is more or less what it will look like.  We also have a second round of page mockups coming soon!
