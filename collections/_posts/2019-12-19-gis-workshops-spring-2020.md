# Update 3/11/2019 - Sessions Cancelled 
## Following the University's decision to move all classes online, the final two workshop sessions have been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Clemons Electronic Classroom, CLEM 407** (take a left as soon as you enter Clemons, the room is sort of behind the reference desk) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. No registration, just show up!

**January 21st - Introduction to ArcGIS Online**

With ArcGIS Online, you can use and create maps and scenes, access ready-to-use maps, layers and analytics, publish data as web layers, collaborate and share, access maps from any device, make maps with your Microsoft Excel data, and customize the ArcGIS Online website.

**January 28th - Find Spatial Data with Living Atlas of the World**

Start your data search with this curated collection of geographic information from around the globe. Demographics-rich census geographies, multispectral imagery, eco data, custom basemaps, and more. We’ll show you how Living Atlas can support your spatial work with maps, apps, and data layers.

**February 4th - Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online**

ArcGIS Online provides a select set of the most common analysis tools, all from the convenience of your browser. Perform basic analysis with tools like Buffer and Spatial Join. Or, enhance your data, taking advantage of the always up-to-date elevation, streets, and demographics data available in ArcGIS Online with tools like Create Viewshed, Find Nearest, and Enrich. Come learn spatial analysis while we regale you with stories about the old days when we had to create all that data ourselves. Uphill. Both ways!! 

**February 11th - Advanced Web Mapping and Visualization**

Pop-ups, filters, clustering, advanced symbology. There are many ways to personalize your maps, enhancing the story your data tells. We’ll dive into some of the advanced functionality that allows you to fine-tune your Web Maps.

**February 18th - App Your Map with Web AppBuilder**

Would you like to make a custom online mapping application without have to code?  Us too.  ArcGIS Web AppBuilder allows developers to use drag and drop tools to create responsive mapping applications.  

**February 25th - Tell a Story with Story Map Journal**

Story Maps are templates that allow you to give context to your ArcGIS Online maps.  Whether telling a story, giving a tour or comparing historic maps, Esri Story Maps are easy-to-use applications that create polished presentations. Come learn the ropes with Journal, our favorite “old” Story Map template. With the introduction of the new ArcGIS StoryMaps, these old templates are on the way out.

**March 3rd - Introduction to the New ArcGIS StoryMaps**

Recently introduced, the new StoryMaps sheds the complication of multiple templates in favor of a single builder that promises to replace all the functionality of the old templates. One template to rule them all! Come see what the future of Story Maps looks like. 

**March 17th - Location Analytics with ArcGIS Insights**

Is “location analytics” just a catchy buzzphrase? Probably, but while trendy terminology comes and goes, understanding your data is timeless. We’ll delve into this data analytics tool that allows you to explore your data, spatial and non-spatial, in an interactive workspace. 

**March 24th - Using ArcGIS Online Data Collection Tools**

Whether you are crowd sourcing spatial data or performing survey work, having applications that automatically record location and upload data directly to a mapping application is incredibly useful.
