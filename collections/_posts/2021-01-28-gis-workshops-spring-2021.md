This Spring, we'll be focusing entirely on ArcGIS Online (AGOL), Esri's GIS solution for the cloud. AGOL is browser-based, eliminating any Windows vs. Mac shenanigans, and enabling us to provide temporary access to members of the Charlottesville community that don't have UVA credentials. 

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 1PM to 2PM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration is open until 1 hour before class. Use the links below to register and get a Zoom link. 

**February 9th - Introduction to ArcGIS Online**

With ArcGIS Online, you can use and create maps and scenes, access ready-to-use maps, layers and analytics, publish data as web layers, collaborate and share, access maps from any device, make maps with your Microsoft Excel data, and customize the ArcGIS Online website.

**February 23rd - Spatial Analysis with ArcGIS Online**

ArcGIS Online provides a select set of the most common analysis tools, all from the convenience of your browser. Perform basic analysis with tools like Buffer and Spatial Join. Or, enhance your data, taking advantage of the always up-to-date elevation, streets, and demographics data available in ArcGIS Online with tools like Create Viewshed, Find Nearest, and Enrich. Come to learn and stay for stories about the old days when we had to create all that data ourselves. Uphill. Both ways!!
