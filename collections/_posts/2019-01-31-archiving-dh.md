# The Problem

I have been working in the field of Digital Humanities for about 13 years now.
Most of my time has been on the technical side: setting up the infrastructure
to support DH projects, building the DH projects, maintaining the DH projects.
Actually, most of my time has been with that last one: maintaining DH projects.

There is a huge problem in the DH world and it has to do with lack of
foresight, poor institutional support, and the ever changing face of
technology. To see how this problem emerged and what we can do about it, I
created this really cool website, interactive map, database, 3D model, VR
environment, and leveraged AI to text mine a million scholarly articles about
DH.

That paragraph above is the epitome of what's wrong with DH projects. A grand
idea, a lot of work to create something; and then stop. That's all the thought
that goes into it. To be fair, over the past 13 years I have seen the DH field
become more and more aware of the technical challenges involved in bringing
forth the great new project for the benefit of the field and general humanity.
More attribution is going to the developers who make "the thing." But that is
still not quite enough. It is still just a 2-5 year plan. What about 100 years
from now?

And there-in lies the crux of the problem. For all the good intentions and the
great resources created by DH projects, they won't last. Let's just get it out
there right now. That wonderful new project you just spent years and thousands
on, will be out of date, obsolete, and unavailable in 2, 3, or 10 years.
Whereas that book you published will be in the hands of learners for the next
100 years.

At least, that's the current state of DH projects. Why? Mainly because the
infrastructure for supporting DH projects in the long term is not in place (or
even invented). Past and current DH projects are built on a shaky foundation of
ever changing technology. Unless this issue is addressed head on, all DH
projects are doomed to oblivion.

In the coming months, I will be exploring more about the problems and possible
solutions facing the longevity and usefulness of DH projects. What can we do at
the outset to make projects outlast the technology? Can we rely on current
technology to exist in 10, 30, 50 years? A difficult question, since modern
computers have only been around for about 55 years. What solutions are out
there already for making DH projects "archive ready" from the get go?

# Why
So, one may ask, is all of this work to maintain a DH project really worth the
effort? I guess this all depends on your interpretation of DH projects as
scholarship. If it is scholarship, then it should be maintained and kept
accessible just as much as the dominant information vessel, the book. We
take for granted the infrastructure and resources that are involved with
creating a book. The global book publishing industry is valued by one [estimate
at $143 Billion
USD](https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/10/bookmap-launched-to-size-up-world-publishing/).
That's a lot of infrastructure behind the book. 

Libraries are the maintainers and repositories of scholarship that has reached
book form, then why not too for DH scholarship? My argument in the end, will be
that libraries will need to step in as the infrastructure to support long term
maintenance and "storage" of DH projects.
