As 3D printing technology continues to evolve, two of the most popular methods are Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Stereolithography (SLA). Coincidentally, these are also the methods of 3D printing available at the Scholarsâ€™ Lab Makerspace. Each has its unique advantages, disadvantages, and ideal use cases. 

## Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
FDM, also known as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), is what most people associate with 3D printing. Plastic filament is melted and extruded layer by layer to build an object. The Makerspace mainly uses PLA and PETG but there are other materials with unique properties including ABS and TPU.

## Stereolithography (SLA)
SLA printing uses a completely different approach. It involves curing liquid resin with a laser or UV light to solidify the material layer by layer. This results in highly detailed and precise prints. The Makerspace primarily uses grey resin but other popular resins include tough, flexible, and clear varieties.

## Print Quality and Detail
* FDM: FDM printers produce less detailed prints compared to SLA. The layer lines are more visible, and the resolution is lower, making it less suitable for intricate designs. The lowest layer height our Prusa Mk4 can produce is 0.05mm and the highest is 0.30mm. Infill can be increased to make the print feel heavier but will have a diminishing return on structural integrity. Additionally, higher infill prints are more susceptible to warping.
* SLA: SLA printers excel in producing high-detail prints with smooth surfaces and fine features. The default is 100%  infill so prints will feel heftier. This makes them ideal for applications requiring high precision, such as jewelry, dental models, and intricate prototypes. Our Form 2 can produce prints with as low as 0.025mm layer height and as large as 0.160mm layer height.
## Material Properties
* FDM: FDM offers a wide variety of filament materials with different mechanical properties, including strength, flexibility, and temperature resistance. It's suitable for functional parts and prototypes that require specific material characteristics.
* SLA: While SLA resins offer high detail, they are generally more brittle and less durable than FDM filaments. However, there are specialized resins designed to enhance strength, flexibility, and other properties.
## Print Speed
* FDM: Typically faster than SLA for larger, less detailed prints. The print speed can vary depending on the layer height and infill density. Higher layer height and minimal infill allows for the fastest prints.
* SLA: Slower for large prints due to lower layer heights and the detailed layer curing process. However, SLA can be faster for small, detailed parts because it cures entire layers at once, unlike FDM's line-by-line approach.
## Post-Processing
* FDM: Requires minimal post-processing. Supports can generally be removed by hand, and some sanding may be needed for a better finish.
* SLA: Requires more extensive post-processing, including washing the print in isopropyl alcohol to remove excess resin and curing the print under UV light to achieve full strength. Supports also need to be removed, ideally by cutting them off with a sharp pair of wire cutters so sections of the print are not accidentally removed alongside the supports. Sanding may be necessary for areas contacted by the supports to give the print a proper finish.
## Cost
* FDM: Generally more affordable. Printers and filament are cheaper compared to SLA, with some printers selling for less than $200. 
* SLA: More expensive due to the cost of resin and the need for additional equipment like wash and cure stations. SLA printers themselves also tend to be more expensive.
## Ideal Use Cases
### FDM Printing
* Prototyping: Great for functional prototypes, especially when material properties are important.
* Large Models: Suitable for printing large objects quickly.
* Budget Projects: Ideal for makers on a budget or those new to 3D printing.
### SLA Printing
* High Detail Models: Perfect for models requiring intricate details and smooth surfaces.
* Small Parts: SLA can efficiently produce small, highly detailed parts.
* Professional Applications: Suitable for industries like dental, jewelry, and custom manufacturing where precision is crucial.
## Conclusion
FDM and SLA 3D printing have their strengths and weaknesses making them suited for different types of projects. For high-detail, small parts, SLA is the way to go. However, if you're looking for larger models, or cost-effective printing, FDM is the better option. Understanding these differences will help you select the right 3D printing technology for your specific needs and make the most of your makerspace experience.
