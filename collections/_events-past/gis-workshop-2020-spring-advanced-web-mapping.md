Pop-ups, filters, clustering, advanced symbology. There are many ways to personalize your maps, enhancing the story your data tells. Weâ€™ll dive into some of the advanced functionality that allows you to fine-tune your Web Maps.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Clemons Electronic Classroom, CLEM 407** (take a left as soon as you enter Clemons, the room is sort of behind the reference desk) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. No registration, just show up!
