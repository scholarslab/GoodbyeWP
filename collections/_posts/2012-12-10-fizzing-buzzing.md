Since [Gwen](http://www.scholarslab.org/people/gwen-nally/) just posted her solution to the [Fizz Buzz](http://www.scholarslab.org/praxis-program/fizz-buzz/) homework assignment,  I thought that I would throw mine up here as well. Here is my [solution](https://github.com/bmw9t/LRTHW/blob/master/praxis_exercises/fizz_buzz.rb).

It's pretty similar to Gwen's take on the problem. I just switched the order of a couple things and used a couple shortcuts. I also apparently have a penchant for extra parentheses to help organize things.

I do feel like I perhaps missed the point of the exercise, given that it was tacked onto Wayne's discussion of object-oriented programming and classes. Perhaps we were meant to solve this problem using that approach? In any case, there is no one way to make breakfast; I'll take my approach for now, until I have a better grasp of object-oriented programming. I'll use what I know.
