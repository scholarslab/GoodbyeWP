We held our first ever equipment naming contest this semester. Over 20 names were suggested for each equipment. We had 37 votes tallied. We used rank-choice voting to determine the winners using this handy [RankedVote Chrome Extension](https://www.rankedvote.co/extension). So, without further ado, here are the winning names of our equipment!

Stitch wins with 16 votes. Thread Lasso comes in second with 8 votes. There was a glitch in the software on this election. But Stitch was the clear winner, even without ranked-choice voting.

## Prusa Mini

![3D printer number 3](/assets/post-media/equipment-names/mini.jpg)

The Maker Formerly Known As Prints wins with 7 votes. We'll just call it "Prints" or &weierp;. Cupid comes in second with 4 votes.

## Prusa MK3S+ w/ MMU3

![3D printer number 4](/assets/post-media/equipment-names/mk3s-mmu3.jpg)

Kermit wins with 13 votes. Chewbacca comes in second with 8 votes. Which gets me thinking, next time we name the equipment, we'll go with a theme and name them all ourselves. StarWars, Muppets, and Avatar: The Last Airbender all made appearances.

## Universal Systems Laser cutter

## Formlabs Form 2 Resin Printer

![form 2 printer](/assets/post-media/equipment-names/form2.png)

The Fresh Prints of Bel Air wins with 14 votes. We'll probably shorten that to just Fresh Prints. Artemis comes in distant second with 5 votes.
