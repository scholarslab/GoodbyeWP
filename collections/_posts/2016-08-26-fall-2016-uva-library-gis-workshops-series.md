All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 3PM to 4PM in the Alderman Electronic Classroom, ALD 421** (adjacent to the Scholars’ Lab) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community.

**September 21st - Making Your First Map with ArcGIS**

Here’s your chance to get started with geographic information systems software in a friendly, jargon-free environment.  This workshop introduces the skills you need to make your own maps.  Along the way you’ll get a taste of Earth’s most popular GIS software (ArcGIS) and a gentle introduction to cartography. You’ll leave with your own cartographic masterpieces and tips for learning more in your pursuit of mappiness at UVa.

**September 28th - Georeferencing a Map - Putting Old maps and Aerial Photos on Your Map**

Would you like to see historic map overlaid on modern aerial photography?  Do you need to extract features of a map for use in GIS?  Georeferencing is the first step.  We will show you how to take a scan of a paper map and align in it in ArcGIS.

**October 5th - Getting Your Data on a Map**

Do you have a list of Lat/Lon coordinates or addresses you would like to see on a map?  We will show you how to do just that.  Through ArcGIS’s Add XY data tool and Geocoding (address matching), it is easy to take your tabular lists and generate points on a map.

**October 12th - Points on Your Map: Street Addresses and More Spatial Things**

Do you have a list of street addresses crying out to be mapped?  Have a list of zip codes or census tracts you wish to associate with other data?  We’ll start with addresses and other things spatial and end with points on a map, ready for visualization and analysis.
