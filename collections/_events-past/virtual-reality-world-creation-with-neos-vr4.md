Use the power of the NEOS VR metaverse to construct your own virtual space! Step into virtual reality and combine media elements such as images, video, audio and 3D objects to shape and create your own custom multiplayer-capable world. This free virtual tool can be used to craft unique social hangouts, artistic galleries or academic exhibitions.

**Meet on Clemons 3 in the VR space.**
