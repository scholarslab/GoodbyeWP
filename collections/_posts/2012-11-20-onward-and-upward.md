This week we wrapped up git and got started on Ruby. I’m starting to build the muscle memory with git. Although they are mostly simple tasks I can make a change in an html document, stage those changes, and then commit them to a repository in [github](http://github.com/). This feels like major progress given how I was feeling about git the first weeks. I’m also building up some basic skills with Terminal. I can quickly figure out where in my computer I am, move through directories, build directories and make new documents.

Also, the first half of “[Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/)” went pretty smoothly. I can do basic arithmetic and am reconnecting with my former love of math. Overall I am feeling much more confident with my computer which is a nice change. For example, this past week my computer was headed toward a major meltdown. I spent a lot of time on a separate computer figuring out what could be the problem, accessed my computer infrastructure, identified the problem and then--in a shocking turn of events--FIXED IT! Certainly this is not something we learned in Praxis but one of my major goals coming into this program was feeling more comfortable using digital tools and I already feel much more confident and open to making mistakes and trying again!
