Thanks to Neatline Time user nancymou, we've addressed a bug in Neatline Time where fields added by other plugins to the advanced search form were not recognized by Neatline Time. (In nancymou's case, the other plugin was Exhibit Builder.) So we've put together a bugfix release, [version 1.1.3](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatlinetime/), that addresses this issue. [Download Neatline Time 1.1.3](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins/neatlinetime/) to upgrade.

We're also wrapping up work on Neatline Time to make it compatible with [Omeka 2.0](http://omeka.org). There isn't a tagged version yet, but if you're interested in trying it out (and sending us feedback), feel free to [check out the `develop` branch](https://github.com/scholarslab/NeatlineTime/tree/develop/) from our Github repository. You can also [download a zip of the develop branch](https://github.com/scholarslab/NeatlineTime/archive/develop.zip); you'll just need to rename the unzipped folder to "NeatlineTime". If you do try it out, and run into any problems, feel free to add a ticket to our [issue tracker](http://github.com/scholarslab/NeatlineTime/issues). There's also plenty of time to [contribute a translation](https://scholarslab.org/research-and-development/translating-neatline/) for Neatline Time, or any of the Neatline plugins!
