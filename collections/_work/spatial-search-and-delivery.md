In 2009 and 2010, with generous support from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/odh/), the Scholars’ Lab hosted three tracks of an “Institute for Enabling Geospatial Scholarship.” An outcome of Institute, The Spatial Humanities website – which our participants dubbed not a clearinghouse but a “sharing-house” – was released in 2011 to serve as a community-driven resource for the spatial humanities. As of 2013, it continues to be updated. Community [contributions are welcomed and encouraged](http://spatial.scholarslab.org/contribute).
