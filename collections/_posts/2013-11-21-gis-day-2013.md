November 20, 2013 was [GIS Day](http://gisday.com/).  In our annual tradition here in the Scholars' Lab, we hosted a round of lighting talks with a variety of speakers including several groups from the [Shenandoah Valley Governor's School](http://svgsstudentnews.wordpress.com/).

As always, the had a great mix of disciplines and uses of GIS.  Thanks again to all the participants.  A slide stack of the presentations is available [here](http://teaching.scholarslab.org/courses/2013_GIS_Day/Scholars_Lab_GIS_Day_2013_Presentations.pdf).  Oh, I almost forgot the other part of our GIS Day tradition, GIS Day cake!
