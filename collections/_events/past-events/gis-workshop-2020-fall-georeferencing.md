Would you like to see historical maps overlaid on modern aerial photography?  Do you need to extract features from a map for use in GIS?  Georeferencing is the first step.  We will show you how to take a scan of a paper map and align in it in ArcGIS.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS.  Sessions will be hands-on demonstrations with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance.  All sessions will be taught on **Wednesdays from 10AM to 11AM** and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. Late-comers are welcome and encouraged, registration is open until 1 hour before class.
