We are thrilled to announce the 2019-2020 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 8 fellows from 4 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences and the School of Architecture. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past students!

## Praxis Program

We are delighted to welcome 6 diverse disciplinary team members to the 9th year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:

*	Chloe Downe Welles, Art and Architectural History
*	Janet Dunkelbarger, Art and Architectural History
*	Conor Kenaston, History
*	Natasha Roth-Rowland, History
*	Nicholas Scott, History
*	Lauren Van Nest, Art and Architectural History

Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s new project in the fall!

## Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities

Finally, we are looking forward to working with Jordan Buysse and Leigh Miller, our 2019-2020 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.

*	Jordan Buysse's (English, GSAS) dissertation is titled "The Word and the Bit: Information and 20th/21st Century Literature"
*	Leigh Miller's (Constructed Environment, School of Architecture) dissertation is titled "Being and Place in(between) Video Game Worlds"

These fellows will work with our team throughout the year and over the summer on substantial research projects related to their dissertations. They join a vibrant community of students working in the lab in the coming year as Makerspace Technologists, Cultural Heritage Interns, GIS Technicians, and more.

Special thanks to everyone who served on the application committees that selected these fantastic students. We are looking forward to working with all of them in the coming year!
