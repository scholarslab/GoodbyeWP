Becca Peters was past Scholars' Lab Administrative Assistant staff. During that role, her bio text was:

Becca does event planning and business operations for the team so her clever co-workers can keep on doing their amazingly cool jobs. She has more than 20 years of experience at UVA, having worked in administration, the Darden School, the Law School, and University Development before coming to the Scholars’ Lab in 2008.  She received her BA in History from Purdue University and is now working on her MSW at VCU.  Becca wears lots of hats (wife, mother of two, election official, Girl Scout leader), even though she looks terrible in hats, and loves movies, genealogy, storytelling, music, tattoos, cooking Irish food, and reading for pleasure (which doesn’t happen nearly enough these days).
