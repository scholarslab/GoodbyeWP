This post is by [Amanda](https://bsky.app/profile/literaturegeek.bsky.social), [Claudia](https://bsky.app/profile/claudiaeberger.bsky.social), and [Quinn](https://bsky.app/profile/quinnanya.me)—a few of the many \#DHmakes community members, who've described the community in a couple places. We're gathering those descriptions into one post (though a hashtag in use across multiple platforms is defined by its users, so we aren't the authority, and its use will evolve over time\!).

1. **DH** \= digital humanities (folks using or building digital tools like websites, code, VR to explore humanities areas like culture, history, art, ethics; folks using those kinds of humanities approaches to critique technology)  
2. **Makes** \= craft, making, makerspace types of creative work

We published a peer-reviewed article in the *Korean Journal of Digital Humanities*,["\#DHmakes: Baking Craft into DH Discourse”](https://accesson.kr/kjdh/v.1/1/73/43507), if you want to know a lot about the community's origins, history, and outputs. 

**If you want a ✨tl;dr✨ though, here's a FAQ\!**

**Who started this?**  
We're digital humanities people who incorporate physical making/art into our work (or do it as a hobby and share it online somewhere)\!

**Who is this for?**   
\#DHmakes is loosely folks in digital humanities/libraries/academia/learning-work who craft/make (including as non-job hobby), open to anyone interested. 

**What kinds of things get posted?**

* "I made/am making a thing\!"  
* work related to including craft/textile work in making  
* works-in-progress, fails, public figuring-out how to do some method/project  
* explicitly celebrating, amplifying, encouraging neat craft/make work, whether or not the creators are digital humanities people   
* encouraging sharing "this is my hobby, not my job" crafts   
* getting started

**What kinds of making/crafting?**  
All of them? We're interested in an expansive definition and especially things that have sometimes gotten left out of how people think of makerspaces/making, such as textile art. Other frequent areas of interest tagged \#DHmakes include craft/making work related to:

* history  
* culture & pop culture  
* zines  
* data visualization & embodiment, including personal data   
* queer/feminist/critical tech, social justice  
* play with historical craft practices  
* expansive definitions of making that assert awesomeness of areas like fabric arts, cooking, fashion

For examples, check out Quinn's [Textile Makerspace](https://textilemakerspace.stanford.edu/), Claudia's and Gabby Evergreen's "[Pockets of Information](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9f1d23f02fa8483f884c1b6d20bf0762)", Jacqueline Wernimont's "[Visualizing Energy Data or Visceralizing Energy Transitions](https://jwernimont.com/visualizing-energy-data-or-visceralizing-energy-transitions/)", and Amanda's [Scholars' Lab "expansive makerspace"-tagged posts page](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/tags/expansive-makerspace).

**Why have I been tagged \#DHmakes?**  
Folks RT/repost cool, relevant craft/making work with the tag so others get to admire them too.

**Am I "DH enough" to use the hashtag?**  
The "DH" in \#DHmakes is digital humanities. We're guessing the other most active hashtag users agree with us: anyone curious about DH (not necessarily "experienced" or in a "DH job") should participate\! Workers, students, hobbyists in areas like gallery/library/archive/museum/learning that are DH or feel adjacent too.

**Have you done things beyond using a hashtag?**  
Yes\!

* A [collaborative making project](http://textilemakerspace.stanford.edu/dhmakes2023) as part of a conference session (ACH 2023\) plus [a blog post](https://textilemakerspace.stanford.edu/blog/dhmakes-at-ach2023/) explaining the different crafts/crafters included  
* A mini-conference (at DH 2024\)  
* A journal special issue: [*dh+lib* Critical Making Special Issue](https://dhandlib.org/2024/04/29/making-research-tactile-critical-making-and-data-physicalization-in-digital-humanities/)  
* A peer-reviewed journal article: ["\#DHmakes: Baking Craft into DH Discourse”](https://accesson.kr/kjdh/v.1/1/73/43507)  
* Series of public "intro to x method" talks ([\#DHmakes Methodz Talks](https://amandavisconti.github.io/DHMakesMethodz/), Fall 2024\)
