Chris Clapp is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics. The theme that unites his research is an analysis of the effects of public policies on individual behavior. He has previously published research that examines on-the-field success as a justification for the public subsidization of new sports stadia. His dissertation seeks to inform policymakers of the effects of congestion pricing policies on commuter behavior, residential location decisions, and ultimately congestion itself. He is also currently involved in a project that evaluates the impact of public interventions in the lives of local at-risk youth.
