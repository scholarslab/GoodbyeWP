This week, I've been preparing for my [Scholars' Lab](http://www.scholarslab.org/) [talk](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?eid=ZGFhMmh0NjZ2NjNuOWk4NnBxOW0xYTMwcGcgOGlrOHBpcGQ2cjY1Z24zaHVyZWM2YWxpMWNAZw&ctz&pli=1&sf=true&output=xml) on Wednesday, April 3rd at noon.  I'll be speaking about [Songs of the Victorians](http://www.songsofthevictorians.com/)  and [Augmented Notes](http://augmentednotes.com/) and demonstrating both of them.  Here's the poster [Ronda Grizzle](http://www.scholarslab.org/people/ronda-grizzle/) designed for it:

 I hope I'll see you there if you live in the area!  There will be a podcast of the talk, and I'll also put my slides up on my blog.








 To help with the upcoming talk, I added the archive page for [Michael William Balfe's "Come into the Garden, Maud"](http://www.songsofthevictorians.com/balfe/archive.html).  I'll be adding the analysis page in the next few weeks.








In terms of Augmented Notes development, I added a new feature that lets users upload multiple pages of a score.  Users can click on the "+ Add another page" link, and a new upload button appears:

Over this coming week, I will try to add two new features: 1. When users click the submit button after setting the measure times, the measure time information will be added to a JSON file;  and 2. Once the previous feature is built, the site will output a .zip file with the html, css, and javascript files necessary for users to have their own very basic archive page like those in Songs of the Victorians.




 Stay tuned for a blog post later this week with my slides from my talk!
