Staff from across the Library are offering learning opportunities through the Scholars' Lab this week!

First, Keith Weimer and Chris Ruotolo will give a workshop on using [syndication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed) to stay on top of news sources and scholarly journals.  Then, Chris Gist and Kelly Johnston will host the first meeting of an ongoing faculty/grad discussion group on geospatial technology for the humanities.  Finally, Ethan Gruber will present an innovative interface he has created to the [UVA Art Museum](http://www.virginia.edu/artmuseum/)'s collection of Greek and Roman coins.

[Check our calendar](http://www2.scholarslab.org/about/events.html#/?p=251) for dates and times!
