## Bring a buddy to make a buddy!

Come to the Tinker tank to make a stuffed buddy! Learn how to create, cut, and
sew a stuffed animal pattern. We provide some premade example patterns or you
can bring your simple pattern to use. If you have a fabric you would like to
recycle, feel free to bring it! Blankets are reccomended.
