title: Brandon Walsh is our New Head of Graduate Programs, starting April 24, 2017

I’m thrilled to announce that Brandon Walsh will join the Library as Head of Graduate Programs in the Scholars’ Lab. This competitive national search revealed the talent that is growing out there: people dedicated to libraries and the pedagogy/service/advanced research model, with the combination of versatile and active technological skills and deep training in humanities or other disciplines. Brandon rose to the top. Currently the Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow, Visiting Assistant Professor of English at Washington and Lee University, he has recently collaborated with the Praxis Program from Lexington, and helped to build a DH curriculum and center in W&L’s library. Brandon holds the PhD in English, UVA; his dissertation, “AudioTextual: Modernism, Sound Recordings, and Networks of Reception,” provides a model of interdisciplinary work for our current graduate students, uniting sound studies, Modernist literary studies, and DH. We’re excited by the work he has continued to publish or present on open educational resources, DH pedagogy, and sound-language studies in audio data sets. Brandon brings further skills needed in the Head of Graduate Programs position: gifts as a teacher (he won a teaching award here); ability to teach digital methods and tools, as in his participation HILT; proven ability to manage grant funds and host public events; integrity and geniality in all kinds of personal interaction. Knowledge of an R1 public university, and this particular one, will help him quickly take a co-leadership role in the Lab. The cohorts of DH and Praxis fellows, and an increasing group of student interns (undergraduate and graduate) will benefit from his inspirational presence.

After his teaching duties at Washington and Lee are completed in April, he will be settling in on April 24 to Purdom Lindblad’s former desk in the Scholars' Lab. Please help us welcome him. Hint: you may see him around C'ville, or he will be virtually present in helping to select next years’ fellows.
