We are thrilled to announce the 2020-2021 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 8 fellows from 6 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past students!

## Praxis Program

We are delighted to welcome 6 team members to the 10th (!) year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:

*	Grace Alvino, English
*	Emma Dove, Art and Architectural History
*	Elise Foote, English
*	Crystal Luo, History
*	Savanna Morrison, Music
*	Aaron Thompson, Slavic Languages and Literatures

Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s new project in the fall!

## Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities

Finally, we are looking forward to working with Janet Dunkelbarger and Michelle Morgenstern, our 2020-2021 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.

*	Janet S. Dunkelbarger's (Art and Architectural History) dissertation is titled "The Garden Dining Spaces of Pompeii: An Archaeological Assessment"
*	Michelle Morgenstern's (Anthropology) dissertation is titled "Play, Purity, & Social Justice: The Poetics of Ethical Discourse in Digital Space"

These fellows will work with our team throughout the year and over the summer on substantial research projects related to their dissertations. They join a vibrant community of students working in the lab in the coming year as Makerspace Technologists, Cultural Heritage Interns, GIS Technicians, and more.

Special thanks to everyone who served on the application committees that selected these fantastic students. We are looking forward to working with all of them in the coming year!
