Erik DeLuca was a 2013-2014 Graduate Fellow. During that role, his bio text was:

Erik DeLuca makes music that moves from being influenced by 90's rock and the New York School of composers, to listening in quiet places. His dissertation, "Fieldworks: a Path to Composing" entwines the boundaries of acoustic ecology, audio documentary, anthropology, and electroacoustic music composition. In 2013 "Winter"&mdash;a piece for orchestra, voice, and recordings of silence&mdash;premiered in Denali National Park by the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival Orchestra and "Community Listening in Isle Royale National Park", a multi-media sonic ethnography, was featured on a panel at the Society for Ethnomusicology Conference. Erik is a PhD candidate in the Music Department at UVa.
