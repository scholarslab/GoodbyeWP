Both postcolonial studies and the digital humanities have gained currency within the academy but are subject to strident critiques from interlocutors. Postcolonial studies has been criticized for being overly reliant on jargon and apolitical, whereas the digital humanities have been taken to task for failing to interrogate questions of race, power, and identity fully. The [Postcolonial Digital Humanities](http://dhpoco.org/) (#dhpoco) intervenes in these gaps through theory and praxis. #dhpoco engages postcolonial studies to address global issues relating to race, gender, class, sexuality, and disability within cultures of technology while bringing the activist praxis of the digital humanities to the work of postcolonial studies. Co-founders Adeline Koh and Roopika Risam will discuss the theoretical underpinnings of #dhpoco and outline the tactics that #dhpoco employs.

Adeline Koh is the director of DH @ Stockton and an assistant professor of literature at Richard Stockton College. Koh is the co-founder of Postcolonial Digital Humanities with Roopika Risam and directs Digitizing Chinese Englishmen, a digital archival project, and The Stockton Postcolonial Studies Project, an online magazine of postcolonial studies. She is the designer of Trading Races, a historical role-playing game for undergraduates,  and is a core contributor to the Profhacker column at the Chronicle of Higher Education.

Roopika Risam is an Assistant Professor of English at Salem State University. Her research interests include postcolonial studies and minority discourse in the United States, and the role of technology in mediating between the two. She is the co-founder of Postcolonial Digital Humanities with Adeline Koh and is co-director of the open-access public domain critical edition of Claude McKay's Harlem Shadows with Chris Forster of Syracuse University.

This event is co-sponsored by [The Carter G. Woodson Institute](http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/woodson/index.html) and the Scholars’ Lab.  As always, it is free, open to all, and requires no advance registration.
