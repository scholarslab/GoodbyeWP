Come learn about the Arduino micro-controller for fun or profit. No experience
needed. This workshop will go through the very basics of electricity, how to
setup the Arduino, and building a first circuit; an LED nightlight. 

This is a virtual, live workshop. After registration, you will recieve a link
for participation. 

You will need to have the following equipment: 
- desktop/laptop computer (for running the Arduino software), 
- Arduino Uno or similar board, 
- breadboard, 
- jumper wires, 
- 100 Ohm resisters, 
- red, green, and yellow LEDs (or any color you can get)

The Arduino software is free to download here: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

Arduino kits can be purchased from Amazon or many other sources:
