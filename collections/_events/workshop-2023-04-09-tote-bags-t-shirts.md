DIY your own tote bag! Pick from different sizes and sew your tote bag together, and learn how to upcycle old t-shirts to make interesting graphics. Materials will be provided, but if you have an old t-shirt with cool graphics that you donâ€™t mind cutting up to put on your tote bag, feel free to bring those along!

No sewing experience required. Drop in anytime between 3:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to make your tote bag.

The Scholars' Lab TinkerTank is located in Clemons Library on the 3rd floor. See here for TinkerTank open hours: <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours</a>
