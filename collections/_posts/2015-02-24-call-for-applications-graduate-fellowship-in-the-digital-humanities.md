Applications for the [Scholars’ Lab](http://scholarslab.org)'s prestigious [Graduate Fellowships in the Digital Humanities](http://scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/) are now being accepted for the 2015-2016 academic year. **Applications are due March 23, 2015.**

The fellowship supports ABD graduate students doing innovative, dissertation-related work in the digital humanities at the University of Virginia. The Scholars’ Lab offers Grad Fellows advice and assistance with the creation and analysis of digital content, as well as consultation on intellectual property issues and best practices in digital scholarship and DH software development.

Fellows join our [vibrant DH community](http://scholarslab.org/people/), have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, can make use of a dedicated grad lounge, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per semester.

Supported by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund, and a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance humanities research and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.
