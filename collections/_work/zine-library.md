Scholars' Lab is active in zine research, making, and distribution. Amanda Wyatt Visconti maintain a collection of zines by authors and on topics of interest to the Lab and its community, including zines on feminist approaches to technology, digital scholarship tutorials, creativity and making, and social justice advocacy.

The project includes:
* Copies of print zines distributed in SLab's Common Room public space
* A digital catalogue of zines, combining the zines we can distribute publicly with others we cannot distribute for various reasons (including only having a single non-reproducable copy in our collection, or zines purchased with staff personal funds).
* A subset of zine titles and metadata in the catalogue is available via a public interface: <a href="https://airtable.com/shr3DDj5X1uNPUzyn/tbl88Svfsrkg3YV5Z">SLab's public zine catalogue view</a>
* Interest in helping UVA groups and local groups (especially student groups doing work in line with our zine collecting areas) print, distribute, and/or archive their zines
* Availability to consult on zine research and teaching uses

## Timeline
* The project began pre-pandemic as a "Zine Wall" in a semi-public space that offered free copies of interesting zines as we happened upon them, and via cross-Library working group meetings and a Slack channel.
* The zine project was virtual-only during the renovation of SLab's physical space in the Main Library (2020-2023).
* In 2024, zines will return to our public space in the renovated Shannon Library (SLab Common Room, Shannon 308).
