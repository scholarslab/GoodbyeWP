![](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/images/b/b4/Day-of-dh-sm-crop.png)Ever wonder how folks in the Scholars' Lab spend their day?  Bethany Nowviskie, Director of Digital Research & Scholarship at the UVA Library and Joseph Gilbert, Head of the Scholars' Lab, recently participated in the "[Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_Humanities)" project initiated by our friends at the University of Alberta.  The "Day of DH" project encouraged scholars, administrators, students, and others who self-identify as "digital humanists" to blog about their day on March 18, 2009.  You can read about [Bethany's day](http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh/BethanyNowviskie/) and [Joseph's day](http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh/JosephGilbert/), as well as the experiences of a [host of other participants](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/List_of_Day_of_DH_Participants).
