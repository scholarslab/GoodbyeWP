The Scholars’ Lab in Alderman Library is opening a new Makerspace in Fall 2014.  It will allow user experimentation with 3D modeling and printing, physical computing (e.g. Arduino, wearables) and more.  We are seeking part-time student assistants to help maintain the public space, field users’ basic maker and general computing (both Mac and PC) questions, and connect researchers to Scholars’ Lab staff when necessary.  When not actively engaged with users, assistants will be asked to pursue their own research, use the equipment, and publish their processes and observations on the Scholars’ Lab blog.

Experience with 3D modeling and printing, electronics, GIS, and/or programming preferred, but can be learned on the job.  The successful candidate will be able to work up to 10 hours per week.

An important aspect of the maker culture is apprenticeship and supporting makers in their pursuit of professional experience. We are looking for motivated individuals who are capable of working independently and value the opportunity to engage with and support a growing community.  Benefits of the job may include: access to expertise and mentoring in your field of interest, use of equipment and tools, and ability to shape Scholars’ Lab workshops and programming.

Candidates should include a cover letter discussing their interest in working in the Scholars’ Lab, detailing any experience or interest in participating in a maker space, and outlining any previous experience with public service or assisting others in using technology.
