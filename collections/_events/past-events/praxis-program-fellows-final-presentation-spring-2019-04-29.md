_Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning_ explores the possibilities for digital research, pedagogy, and play in the [newly expanded public domain](https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/public-domain/). Using Robert Frost’s _New Hampshire_ (1923) as raw material, _Unclosure_ presents a series of tutorials that seek to empower researchers, instructors, and creators to critically engage public-domain materials.
