The Age of Lead examines the relationship between metropolitan development and lead poisoning in Baltimore from the late-nineteenth century to the late-twentieth century. In particular, I trace how concerns about environmental health in the city fostered the desire for suburban living, but how suburbanization deepened and even caused disparities in lead hazards between the suburbs and the inner city. His dissertation won the 2017 Council of Graduate Schools/ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award in the Humanities and Fine Arts, and we helped him process and visualize his map data.
