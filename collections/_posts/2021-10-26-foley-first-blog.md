Navigating a PhD program in your late-30’s is a humbling process. The inevitable and overwhelming
feeling of imposter-syndrome is exacerbated at a ‘public ivy’ like the University of Virginia when you
come from limited financial resources, had no exposure to academia, and very little ‘classic’ training.
Within the academy, we are often conditioned to hide our own inadequacies and expose the deficiencies
of others, a practice I have struggled with significantly.  
<br />
My first several years in the PhD program were painful to say the very least. My style of communication,
background, and approach to life, did not fit well within a traditional model of academic training. What I
lacked in pedigree, I attempted to make up for with a willingness to work seemingly endless hours. After
nearly 3 years of mimicking the toxic practices promoted within the academy, which induced a deep
depression and stress-related neurological issues, I re-prioritized my physical, emotional, and mental
health.  
<br />
Despite the obvious struggles, my time at UVA has been enriching beyond measure. My experiences
teaching over the past three years reinforced my desire to become an educator. Although it has been difficult
for me to communicate in the same academic language as most of my colleagues, the undergraduates
have made the entire process worthwhile. Additionally, my advisor has become one of the most
influential mentors I have ever had.  
<br />
Throughout my four years at UVA, I have heard countless positive testaments about the Scholars’ Lab
from colleagues, students and faculty. Although I have only been a Praxis Fellow for several weeks, my
experience with the Scholars’ Lab staff has been refreshing and heartening. My technological skills are
severely lacking and the thought of writing code is mind numbing, but the spirit of the Scholars’ Lab has
been unlike anything I have experienced within academia. Despite knowing much less about coding than
my particular field of scholarship, I have been treated like a colleague rather than a ‘grad student’ — an
incredibly rare dynamic within the academy.  
<br />
If I could pass a message to future Praxis’ Fellows, it would be to get in some coding practice in the
summer (especially if you have limited experience like myself), but regardless of your expertise, expect to
be treated with respect and compassion by the Scholars’ Lab staff. I have already been reprimanded by
my support crew for putting in too many hours. I need to remember that I can’t attain years of knowledge
in a matter of months. I also need to appreciate the very small steps forward I’m constantly making. I can
already sense that my experience with Praxis will be one of the highlights of my time at UVA, while also
offering me an entirely different, and refreshing, perspective of the academy.
