The Scholars' Lab supports a diverse community of digital scholars and scholarly makers across the University and beyond. As Assistant Director for Scholars' Lab Public Services, my main goal is to foster and grow that community. I convene our [speaker events and workshops](http://scholarslab.org/events/), designed to connect researchers - at all levels - with expertise, training, and intellectual discourse. I also manage our [Makerspace](http://scholarslab.org/makerspace/) and serve as the primary point of contact between the Scholars’ Lab and broader library services.

I have a background in English and information science, was the librarian on the Fall 2015 voyage of [Semester at Sea](http://www.semesteratsea.org/), and have an ongoing interest in digital publishing and open scholarly communication.
