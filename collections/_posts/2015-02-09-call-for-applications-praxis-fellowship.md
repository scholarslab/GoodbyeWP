UVa grad students! Apply by **March 2** for a unique, funded opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary group of your peers, learning digital humanities skills from the experts, and collaboratively design and execute an innovative digital project. The 2015-2016 Praxis cohort will get underway in September, thanks to generous support by the [UVa Library](http://www.library.virginia.edu/) and the endorsement of [GSAS](http://gsas.virginia.edu/).

Each year, the [Scholars’ Lab](http://scholarslab.org/) Praxis Program provides six UVa graduate students with hands-on experience in digital humanities collaboration and project creation. Team members work to take a shared project from conception to design and development, and finally to publication, community engagement, and analysis. [Praxis](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/) is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows [blog](http://scholarslab.org/archives/) about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of Scholars’ Lab faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. The program prepares fellows with digital skills they can apply to the Praxis fellowship project as well as to their future research.

In 2012, the Scholars’ Lab inspired like-minded institutions to create the [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org/), made up of allied but differently-inflected humanities education initiatives from around the world, mainly focused on graduate training, and all engaged in rethinking pedagogy and campus partnerships in relation to the digital humanities. The [Praxis Network Student Directory](http://praxis-network.org/students) showcases how Praxis Program alumni have traveled diverse career paths, including tenure-track teaching and distinguished digital humanities positions within academic libraries and research centers.

We will welcome six new, competitively-selected students to the UVa Praxis Program in late August 2015. _**This fellowship replaces recipients' teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote approximately 10 hours per week in the fall and spring semesters to learning together and building a collaborative digital humanities project in the Scholars’ Lab.**_ Fellows join our [vibrant community](http://scholarslab.org/people/), have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated grad lounge.

All University of Virginia graduate students working within or committed to the humanities are eligible to apply to join the 2015-16 cohort. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.

Apply by emailing an expression of interest to [Purdom Lindblad](mailto:jpl8e@virginia.edu), indicating the applicant’s



	
  * research interests,

	
  * summary of plan for use of digital technologies in the applicant’s research,

	
  * summary of skills, interests, and methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program,

	
  * and a statement of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow.


Applicants must be available for in-person interviews on Grounds between March 16th and 27th.

For questions about the [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org) or the [application process](http://scholarslab.org/graduate-fellowships/), please email [Purdom Lindblad](mailto:jpl8e@virginia.edu).
