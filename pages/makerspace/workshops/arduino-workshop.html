          <p>In this workshop, we&rsquo;ll go through the basics of electricity, learn about
            some of the components, and then put together a few circuits.</p>

          <p id="script-basics">Basics of Electricity</p>
          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 5]</span></p>
          <p> Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to grasp electrical current and what
            happens in a circuit because you can&rsquo;t see what is happening
            inside the components. To help visualize the electrical concepts, you
            can imagine electrical current flowing through a circuit similar to
            water flowing through a system of pipes.

          </p>
          <p>1. Electrons = water</p>
          <p>2. Wires = pipes</p>
          <p>3. Battery = Reservoir and pump</p>
          <p>4. Voltage = The pump creates pressure in the system. In a house,
            your water pressure is usually between 50 and 80 psi. This is like
            the difference in electrical potential between the negative and
            positive side of the battery. This potential difference is called
            voltage.</p>
          <p>5. Amperage = The rate that the water flows through the pump is
            like the rate at which the electrons travel in a circuit.</p>
          <p>6. Resistance = making the pipe smaller or putting in a sponge or
            filter.</p>

          <p>Water pipes need to be all connected in order for the water to
            flow. If there is a break in a pipe, then the system is broken.</p>

          <p>Similarly, in an electronic circuit, all the components need to
            connect to each other in such a way that the electrons can freely
            flow from the negative to the positive side of the power source. If
            there is a break, the electrons don&rsquo;t flow out like in a water
            circuit, they just don&rsquo;t flow at all. Sometimes this is done
            intentionally, this is called a switch.</p>

          <p>Switch = intentionally opening and closing a gap in the circuit.</p>

          <p>This is perhaps the most important concept for this workshop and
            when working with Arduinos. If the circuit is not working, the
            circuit is probably incomplete somewhere. So that is the first thing
            to always check. Make sure everything is plugged in where it is
            supposed to be plugged in. </p>

          <p>Any questions so far?</p>

                <li>An electrical circuit needs power, or a source of stored
                  electrons. To power an Arduino, you can use a battery, a wall
                  outlet adapter, or a USB cable to a computer. </li>

                <li> We use wires to connect the different components to each other
                  and the Arduino. All of the wires are the same inside. The colors
                  are to help you organize your circuit.</li>

                <li> Resistors are bi-directional, meaning that they can be used in
                  a circuit in any position. We use the resistors to restrict the
                  current to certain components. &nbsp;Resistors have colored bands
                  on them to denote how much resistance they have. </li>

                <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
                <li>A photoresistor is a special kind of resistor. It changes
                  resistance based on how much light is detected. In our pipe
                  analogy, you can think of it like a sponge that grows more dense or
                  more porous depending on the light.

            <li>LED (light emitting diode)
              <ul>
                <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
                <li>The LED, or Light Emitting Diode, is a component that is
                  directional, meaning it allows electrons to flow through in only
                  one direction. This would be like a one-way valve in a water pipe.
                  As electrons flow through the diode, they lose energy in the form
                  of light. Because LEDs are directional, there are two ways to
                  determine the negative or positive side.
                  <br>
                  First, there is a flat spot on the &ldquo;brim&rdquo; of the LED to
                  denote the negative side. Second, the &ldquo;leads&rdquo; or legs
                  of the LED are different lengths. The positive, or
                  &ldquo;cathode&rdquo; side is longer. The negative, or
                  &ldquo;anode&rdquo; side is shorter. Just as a plus sign has more
                  to it than a negative sign, the positive lead is longer than the
                  negative.
                </li>
                <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
                <li>In a wiring diagram, the positive side of the LED is denoted
                  with a bent lead. </li>

                <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
                <li>The breadboard is simply an easy way to connect a bunch of
                  components together. The holes are connected in the back by rows of
                  metal. If you were to remove the protective paper from the back,
                  you would see the image on the left, how the rows are connected and
                  the two columns on either side are connected.
                </li>
                <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
                <li>For instance, the holes a, b, c, d, e in row 1 are all
                  connected to each other, but nothing else.</li>

                <li>Arduinos are small mico-controllers that allow you to gather
                  input from sensors (like sound, motion, temperature, humidity,
                  light, etc), through code impart some logic based on that input,
                  and then generate some kind of output (like sound, motion, light,
                  etc).
                </li>
                <li>For example, you can have a sensor that detects light, then
                  your code can determine to turn on or off an LED based on how much
                  light was detected. That&rsquo;s the basics of a nightlight, which
                  we will construct at the end of this workshop.

            <li>
              The two most important things to check after opening the Arduino
              software are 1) the board, and 2) the port.
            </li>
            <li>If you go to the Tools menu, you&rsquo;ll see a submenu
              for Board: and a submenu for Port.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Check The Board</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Click on the Board submenu to see the various types of Arduino
              boards you can connect to. For this workshop, you&rsquo;ll either
              use the Arduino Uno or the Arduino 101.
            </li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>You may need to look down at the very bottom of the list to
              find your board.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 10]</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If your specific Arduino board is not present, click on the
              Board Manager&hellip; menu to bring up the board manager.</li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>Search for your board and click the Install button.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Check The Port</p>
          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 11]</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Next, make sure the Arduino is plugged into the computer with the USB port.
              There is only one way the cable can go.</li>
            <li>Select the Tools menu, then the Port submenu.
              There should be an option there that has the name of the Arduino
              board. Select that port.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Check Code and Upload</p>
          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 12]</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Next we&rsquo;ll look at two buttons in the IDE that are useful.</li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span> Zoom in to the buttons..</li>
            <li>First is the code check button. This checks your code for
              errors, and if there are any errors, it will let you know.</li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>The second button checks your code, and then sends it to the
              Arduino if there are no errors.</li>
            <li>You usually just need the second button.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Writing Your Code</p>
          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 13]</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each new document you start is pre-filled with a couple of
              pieces of code. In Arduino language, these documents are called
              sketches. They can also be called scripts, or code files.
            </li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span>&nbsp;</li>
            <li>The first piece of code is called the setup function. A
              function is like a bunch of code you write that can be used again
              later, just by using the function&rsquo;s name.
            </li>
            <li>Line 1 starts our function. Here we use the word
              &lsquo;void&rsquo; to tell Arduino what kind of function it is. It
              is a function that doesn&rsquo;t return any information, it just
              does something, so it is a &lsquo;void&rsquo; function. The name of
              the function is &lsquo;setup&rsquo;. The parentheses designate if
              we can pass information to the variable when it is called/run/used.
              In this case there is nothing. Then finally, we have an open curly
              brace to say, this is where the function&rsquo;s code starts, and a
              closing curly brace on line 4 to say, this is where the setup
              function&rsquo;s code ends.
            </li>
            <li>Line 2 is just a comment. The Arduino just ignores this line.
              It&rsquo;s just there for us humans.</li>
            <li>Line 3 is left blank.</li>
            <li>Line 5 is just an empty line.</li>
            <li> We would use the setup function to tell the Arduino to do
              stuff as soon as it loads the code. It does all of the stuff in the
              function once, then moves on to the next function.
            </li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>The second piece of code is another &lsquo;void&rsquo; function called
              loop.</li>
            <li>Line 6 starts the function, it&rsquo;s type is void, there are no
              parameters passed into the function (nothing between the parentheses). </li>
            <li>Line 7 is another comment.</li>
            <li>Line 8 is blank.</li>
            <li>And line 9 is the closing curly brace.</li>
            <li>When the Arduino gets to this function, it runs the code inside
              over and over again as fast as it can. It loops over the code
              continuously until the Arduino loses power or you send it new code.

          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 15]</span></p>
          <p>Put together a circuit like this. An LED connected to a 100Ohm resistor

            <li>Reminder: the LED might start blinking, depending on what code
              already is on the Arduino.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 16]</span></p>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span>&nbsp;</li>
            <li>In the setup function, you&rsquo;ll tell the Arduino to send
              out a current on pin 12 using a new function called pinMode. This
              tells the Arduino that a specific pin is either sending out current
              (OUTPUT) or receiving current (INPUT).
            </li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span>&nbsp;</li>
            <li>In the loop function, you&rsquo;ll use a new function to tell
              the Arduino to actually send current to the specified pin using the
              digitalWrite function. This function needs a pin number and a value
              of HIGH or LOW. (See the Deeper Understanding section for more on
              why HIGH or LOW instead of ON or OFF.)

          <p id="script-night-light">Night Light Circuit!</p>
          <p>Now we move on to the next component needed for making our
            nightlight, the photoresistor. Remember the photoresistor changes its
            resistance based on the amount of light it senses. We&rsquo;ll use
            this ability to determine when to turn the LED on or off.
          </p>
          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 18]</span></p>
          <p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to add the photoresistor to your circuit.
            This will need to be connected to a voltage output, the 5v pin, and
            to ground, the GND pin, with a 10K Ohm resistor. A third wire will
            connect to the photoresistor at the point where the resistor connects
            and then connect to analog pin zero on the Arduino, marked as A0.
          </p>

          <p>The Arduino can&rsquo;t actually detect the amount of resistance a
            component is contributing to the circuit, but it can detect the
            difference in current or voltage. The photoresistor and the 10K Ohm
            resistor create a circuit called a voltage divider. Think of it as
            two sponges in a water pipe. If you know the flow of water going into
            the pipe and the &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; of one spong, then as the
            other sponge changes and you observe the new flow rate, you can
            calculate the resistance of the second sponge. In any case, we are
            able to use the change in potential current (the voltage) using the
            photoresistor and a second resistor, which allows us to calculate the
            change in resistance.
          </p>

          <p>We then use that number in the logic of our software to determine
            when to turn on the LED.</p>

          <p><span class="slide">[Show slide 19]</span></p>
          <p>Now we can update our code in the Arduino IDE program. This sketch introduces
            two new programming concepts; variables and the if...else logic structure.</p>
          <p>The first, as seen on lines 3, 4, and 5 is that of creating a
            variable. A variable, in programming, is like a box that we put
            information in. There are four parts to making a variable in the
            Arduino language.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>First, we must specify what kind of information can be stored in this
              variable. In this case we need a number, so we use integer, or int. </li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>Some of the most used options are
              <ul>
                <li>int = numbers</li>
                <li>float = numbers with a decimal point</li>
                <li>char = &nbsp;all characters</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>Second, the label, or name, of the variable.</li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>Third, we use the single equal sign to assign a value to the variable. This
              is what puts the information into the box.</li>
            <li><span class="slide">[Progress slide]</span></li>
            <li>Fourth, the value that we want to store in the variable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On line 3, we create a variable to hold the sensitivity value. The
            higher the number the more sensitive the nightlight is. The
            photoresistor will send a value from 0 to 1023. Let&rsquo;s say that
            the amount of light in the room means the photoresistor gives us a
            value of 500. A value of 100 for the threshold means that when the
            value of the sensor drops below 400, then the LED will turn on. If we
            set the threshold to 20, then the LED would turn on when the
            photoresistor sends a value of 480.
          </p>

          <p>On lines 4 and 5, we create two variables that have no value. We
            create, or &lsquo;instantiate&rsquo;, the variables here so that we
            can use them later. This has to do with the scope of the variable, or
            which parts of the code can &lsquo;see&rsquo; or recognize the
            variable and its value or not. The &lsquo;resistance&rsquo; variable
            will eventually hold the value of the photoresistor everytime the
            code checks for it. The &lsquo;initialPhotoValue&rsquo; will hold the
            value of the photoresistor when the code runs for the first time.
          </p>

          <p>On line 7, we start the setup function.</p>

          <p>On line 8, we set the mode for pin 12 to be output, we&rsquo;ll be
            sending current to the LED on pin 12.</p>

          <p>On line 9, we grab the value of the photoresistor and assign the
            value to the variable &lsquo;initialPhotoValue&rsquo; that we created
            on line 5. We want to grab the value of the photoristor here because
            this value totally depends on how much light there is in the room.
            This value is dependent upon the amount of light in the room each
            time the Arduino is turned on and the code is run.
          </p>

          <p>We use the analogRead() function, and pass zero as the parameter.
            This means we will read in the value of the photoresistor that is
            plugged into pin A0 on the Arduino. The A stands for Analog.
          </p>

          <p>On line 12, we start the loop function.</p>

          <p>On line 15, we read the current value of the photoresistor. This
            value possibly changes each time the code loops through.</p>

          <p>On line 19, we start the other new programming concept, the
            if...else statement. This is a logic statement that allows us to make
            a test of some values, and then based on the result the Arduino will
            run certain code. This line starts the if statement with the word
            &lsquo;if&rsquo;. Then in parenthesis we put the condition that is
            tested. In this case, we want to see if the current value of the
            photoresistor is less than the initial value minus the threshold.
            Let&rsquo;s say that the current value of the photoresistor is 400,
            and the initial value was 645, and our threshold is 100. We can
            substitute those values in for the variables to test whether the
            equation is true or not. Is 400 less than 645 - 100?
          </p>

          <p>If that is true, the code on line 20 is run, or executed, and
            lines 21-23 are ignored. If that is false, then line 20 is ignored,
            and line 22 is executed.</p>

          <p>Notice the curly braces on lines 19, 21 and 23. Their purpose is
            similar to the curly braces used by the functions setup and loop.
            They let the program know what code is encapsulated, or enclosed, or
            belongs, to the &lsquo;if&rsquo; or the &lsquo;else&rsquo; part of
            the statement.
          </p>

          <p>So, if the current value of the photoresistor is less than the
            initial value minus the threshold, then line 20 is executed. The
            digitalWrite function, or method, is used to send current to pin 12
            which is connected to the LED.

          <p>Troubleshooting Tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Check that the circuit is correct. Plug each wire and component in exactly
              as shown on the diagram if necessary.</li>
            <li>Check that there are no missing semicolons. The Arduino IDE will give visual
              clues in the code (squiggle underlines, etc). </li>
            <li>Check for errors in the output section of the IDE.</li>
            <li>Double check that the Board and Port are correct.</li>

  <h2 id="deeper-understanding">Deeper Understanding</h2>
  <p>Q: Why are HIGH and LOW used to designate a pin as on or off?</p>
  <p>A: <a
      href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/constants/constants/">https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/constants/constants/</a>
  </p>

  <p>Defining Pin Levels: HIGH and LOW</p>
  <p>When reading or writing to a digital pin there are only two possible
    values a pin can take/be-set-to: HIGH and LOW.</p>
  <p>HIGH</p>
  <p>The meaning of HIGH (in reference to a pin) is somewhat different
    depending on whether a pin is set to an INPUT or OUTPUT. When a pin is
    configured as an INPUT with pinMode(), and read with digitalRead(), the
    Arduino (ATmega) will report HIGH if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a voltage greater than 3.0V is present at the pin (5V boards)</li>
    <li>a voltage greater than 2.0V volts is present at the pin (3.3V boards)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>A pin may also be configured as an INPUT with pinMode(), and subsequently
    made HIGH with digitalWrite(). This will enable the internal 20K pullup
    resistors, which will pull up the input pin to a HIGH reading unless it is
    pulled LOW by external circuitry. This can be done alternatively by passing
    INPUT_PULLUP as argument to the pinMode() function, as explained in more
    detail in the section &quot;Defining Digital Pins modes: INPUT, INPUT_PULLUP,
    and OUTPUT&quot; further below. </p>

  <p>When a pin is configured to OUTPUT with pinMode(), and set to HIGH with
    digitalWrite(), the pin is at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>5 volts (5V boards)</li>
    <li>3.3 volts (3.3V boards)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this state it can source current, e.g. light an LED that is connected
    through a series resistor to ground.</p>

  <p>LOW</p>
  <p>The meaning of LOW also has a different meaning depending on whether a pin
    is set to INPUT or OUTPUT. When a pin is configured as an INPUT with
    pinMode(), and read with digitalRead(), the Arduino (ATmega) will report LOW
    if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a voltage less than 1.5V is present at the pin (5V boards)</li>
    <li>a voltage less than 1.0V (Approx) is present at the pin (3.3V boards)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When a pin is configured to OUTPUT with pinMode(), and set to LOW with
    digitalWrite(), the pin is at 0 volts (both 5V and 3.3V boards). In this
    state it can sink current, e.g. light an LED that is connected through a
    series resistor to +5 volts (or +3.3 volts). </p>
