Got data, but not certain how it might be displayed digitally with its particular numeric, spatial and temporal attributes? This workshop promises an introduction to [VIDI](http://www.dataviz.org/), a user friendly suite of [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) modules for displaying, graphing and mapping data, with illustrations from the [Patchwork Nation](http://www.patchworknation.org/) project.
