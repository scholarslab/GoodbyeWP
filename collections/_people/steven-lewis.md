Steven Lewis was a Praxis Fellow 2014–2015. During that role, his bio text was:

I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia and earned a BA in Jazz Studies from Florida State University. I am currently in my second year of the PhD in the Musicology program at UVA. My research interests include late 20th century jazz neoclassicism, early jazz, and 19th century African-American secular music. I developed an interest in the digital humanities during the first year of my PhD and am very excited to broaden my knowledge as a 2014-2015 Praxis Fellow. In my spare time, I enjoy practicing my instruments, researching my family history, and cooking.
