# New Year and New Role

It is my extreme pleasure to announce a change in roles for me (Ammon Shepherd)
in the Scholarâ€™s Lab. Beginning this new year, I will be the full-time Manager
of the Scholarsâ€™ Lab Makerspace and the Lead Research Technologist. I started
in the Scholarsâ€™ Lab 5 years ago as a Digital Humanities Developer, building
websites, working on various projects, and helping to maintain our technical
infrastructure.  Since then I have enjoyed learning the technology and skills
available in the Makerspace, and, [like the metaphorical
camel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_nose), I found a way to get
myself all in. ðŸ˜Š 

From the beginning (Summer 2014), the Makerspace had a great vision
under the outstanding leadership of Laura Miller and Jeremy Boggs. As their
roles have changed over the years, this left an opportunity for me to join the
Makerspace team full-time. As Manager, I will oversee the administration and
day-to-day running of the Makerspace and supervise our wonderful team of
student employees who we affectionately call Makerspace Technologists. As the
Lead Research Technologist, I will conduct research about Makerspace
technology, methodology and pedagogy, and collaborate with scholars throughout
the UVA community. 

With the new year and the new decade, weâ€™ve enhanced our vision of the
makerspace, and put in place a mission. 

## Scholarsâ€™ Lab Makerspace Vision 
The Scholarsâ€™ Lab Makerspace is strategically situated within the UVA Library
to be open, provide a low barrier to entry, and be a helpful resource of
information, technology and support. The space invites all people, and
proactively encourages those in underrepresented academic studies, ethnicities,
genders, economic classes and skill levels to come, learn, make, and be
empowered to improve their education, research, and community. The Makerspace
is an active participant in academic research through independent and
collaborative work with scholars to explore, understand, and report on emerging
technologies, methodologies and pedagogies in a variety of disciplines. 

## Mission 
All humans are dreamers, creators, and achievers. Our mission is to provide the
place, the tools, and the support to empower people to dream, create, and
achieve.

## Follow Us
I encourage you to check the blog often this year, and our social media pages,
as we will be more active in posting the very cool things that the UVA
community creates in the Makerspace.
