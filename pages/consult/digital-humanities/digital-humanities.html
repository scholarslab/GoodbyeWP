<h2>Critical DH: Theory & Scholarly Field</h2>

<p>Scholars' Lab offers expertise in the critical digital humanities (DH). Much of the lab's work draws on our strong DH background (including for non-DH projects and people!) and many of our staff identify as digital humanists. We use "critical" DH here to mean purposeful engagements with the field and community of DH scholarship, including its writings, theory, and international community.</p>

<p>Our four areas of high-level expertise (<a href="/code-design">code + design</a>, <a href="/spatial-technologies">spatial technologies</a>, <a href="/makerspace">makerspace</a>, <a href="/dh-pedagogy">DH pedagogy</a>) all routinely overlap with critical DH work, including through consultation, collaboration, teaching, staff-initiated research, and staff leadership and service in external discplinary and methodological fields. Beyond these, &quot;critical DH&quot; captures our high level of engagement in external, international DH leadership, service, and community:</p>

<p><strong>This active leadership and engagement directly benefits UVA</strong>, allowing us to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>stay up to date on the latest trends in theory, methodologies, tools, equipment; ready to help UVA folks when they come to use wanting to learn about something new</li>
<li>participate in <em>setting</em> trends in digital scholarship, including through our prominent model as a DH center focused on social justice, community care, and growing the next generation of DH scholars</li>
<li>alert you to the latest opportunities (e.g. grants, conferences)</li>
<li>easily amplify your work through our social media channels and personal connections</li>
<li>connect you to external collaborators, mentors, and reviewers</li>
<li>invite exciting, innovative public speakers to UVA</li>
<li>help you explore and apply for careers and external fellowships (including alternative academic, non-academic, technology, and galleries/archives/libraries/museums roles)</li>
</ul>

<p>Our <a href="/blog">award-winning research blog</a> and active, influential academic social media presence are key to our ongoing Critical DH scholarship. We&#39;re a founding member of Centernet, the international alliance of digital humanities organizations, and one of the DH centers with the most dedicated DH staff in the world. Our staff are in-demand external DH speakers, hold current and past elected and appointed leadership roles with <a href="https://ach.org">our international digital humanities scholarly organization</a>, and serve as editors on peer-reviewed DH and DH-adjacent publications such as <a href="programminghistorian.org">The Programming Historian</a> and <a href="https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/journals/jitp">The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</a>. We are sought out by deans, administrators, and faculty at an international array of universities for advice and consultation on creating and improving their DH centers, initiatives, and curricula. Our specialty in nurturing the next generation of DH scholars means we have an active network of SLab alumni who have gone on to found their own, SLab-influence DH nodes at places including Yale, CUNY, and Columbia University.</p>

<p>Our Critical DH work takes forms including an external speaker series focused on identifying exciting early career digital humanists charting where DH will go next; offering themed reading recommendations and bibliographies; maintaining a DH reference collection (Digital Humanities Working Library), and publishing written DH methodological tutorials.</p>

<h2>DH Projects: Project Design + Management, Code + Design, Methods Training</h2>
	<p>For faculty and students interested in digitial humanities, we provide research and teaching consultation on a variety of concepts, approaches, and tools, including digital collections & exhibitions, data collection and management, machine learning, text analysis, and more. We have a broad familiarity with a diverse variety of technologies, but our particular strengths lie in the critical pedagogical and scholarly application of those technologies for the humanities.</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Background research and developing a bibliography of existing DH work relevant to your particular project or research interests</strong>. It's likely the research project you're developing already has peer in the DH world, similar either in topic, discipline, or technical features and approach. The Scholars' Lab can help you review existing work to establish how your own contribution fits into that. Similar to doing a literature review for your book or dissertation, but with digital projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Project scoping and management</strong>. We can help you take your broader ideas and help develop them into a list of concrete, actionable tasks or deliverables that you can work on. If youâ€™re not sure how complex your project will be, we can also help you scope it out.</li>
	<li><strong>Evaluating tools and methods relevant to your work</strong>. We have experience with a range of programming languages, markup languages, content management systems, and libraries, and can provide recommendations based on your interests and level of experience.</li>
	<li><strong>User experience and interface design</strong>. We have experience researching and designing project interfaces that engage critically with subject matter in a variety of disciplines.</li>
	<li><strong>Data collection, cleaning, organization, management and preservation</strong>. Whether it's arranging a corpus of texts, structuring an archive of historical primary source materials, or acquiring social media data, we can help you work with your research and teaching data.</li>
	<li><strong>Conference and publication proposals</strong>. Our team, and other staff at the Scholars' Lab, have decades of experience publishing or sharing DH research at conferences and in academic journals. If you're interested in submitting proposals based on your DH work, we'd be glad to help review those proposals and offer suggestions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Whether you're a student working on a digital humanities project for a class, or you're faculty wishing to learn more about using particular DH methods or tools in course or research, we can help you find appropriate resources for your work.</p>

<h2>DH Pedagogical Consultation & Collaboration</h2>

<p>The lab offers expertise in digital humanities (DH) and experimental scholarship pedagogies, including at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels. We offer consultation, syllabus review, co-teaching, and other forms of support for developing digital pedagogy and implementing it in the classroom, and our leadership and participation in the <a href="/critical-dh">external DH community</a> allows us to inform and be informed by the latest DH pedagogy research and practice.</p>

<p>We frequently publish on critical digital pedagogies, including in peer-reviewed journals such as <a href="https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/a-way-in-digital-pedagogy-training-with-speculative-low-tech-workshops/section/d26fab6f-c473-489a-9516-a6e6f0c747a7">The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</a>; in edited volumes including <em>The Digital Futures of Graduate Study in the Humanities</em> and <em>What We Teach When We Teach DH: Digital Humanities in the Classroom</em>; and in other public formats such as <em><a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/">Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments</a></em> and <em>#DLFTeach Toolkit: Lesson Plans for Digital Library Instruction</em>.</p>
