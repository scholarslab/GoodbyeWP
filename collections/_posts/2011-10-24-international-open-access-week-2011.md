October 24 - 30 is International Open Access Week 2011. Now in its fifth year, International Open Access Week, sponsored by [openaccessweek.org](http://openaccessweek.org/), is dedicated to educating scholars and university administrators about authors' rights, copyright, and the importance of creating and maintaining free access to scholarship.

[Openaccessweek.org](http://openaccessweek.org/) encourages scholars to allow unfettered access to the products of their scholarship by publishing in open access journals and depositing their pre- and post-prints in open access institutional repositories. Additionally, openaccessweek.org encourages university and departmental administrators to update policies for tenure and promotion so that publication in peer-reviewed, digital, open access journals is given the same weight as publication in traditional print publications.

In support of open access here at UVa, the University has implemented an institutional repository called [Libra](http://libra.lib.virginia.edu/), maintained and administered by the Library, in which faculty members are encouraged to deposit their research. More information about Libra, open access at UVa, and instructions for depositing articles is available from the [Frequently Asked Questions page](http://libra.lib.virginia.edu/about/) on the Libra website.
