In observation of the [expansion of the public domain in 2019](https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/public-domain/), <i>Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning</i> examines how U.S. copyright law interacts with digital research and pedagogy. Working with Robert Frostâ€™s New Hampshire (1923), the project presents a series of tutorials that demonstrate how to use a public domain work in order to empower our audience to understand, transform, and intervene in the range of material now available online.
