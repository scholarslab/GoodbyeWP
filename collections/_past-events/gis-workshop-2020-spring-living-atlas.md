Start your data search with this curated collection of geographic information from around the globe. Demographics-rich census geographies, multispectral imagery, eco data, custom basemaps, and more. Weâ€™ll show you how Living Atlas can support your spatial work with maps, apps, and data layers.

All sessions are one hour and assume participants have no previous experience using GIS. Sessions will be hands-on with step-by-step tutorials and expert assistance. All sessions will be taught on **Tuesdays from 2PM to 3PM in the Clemons Electronic Classroom, CLEM 407** (take a left as soon as you enter Clemons, the room is sort of behind the reference desk) and are free and open to the UVa and larger Charlottesville community. No registration, just show up!
