[Last week](http://scholarslab.org/events/uva-medieval-colloquium-kathleen-kennedy/) the Scholar’s Lab and The Medieval Colloquium @ UVA had the pleasure of hosting [Professor Kathleen Kennedy](http://sites.psu.edu/kek16/). Kathleen came to us from Penn State-Brandywine where she teaches all things Medieval. Recently, though, Kathleen’s interest in medieval materiality&mdash;with particular regard to the book&mdash;has lead her in some new directions.

Over the course of a workshop and a talk, and a lot of food, Kathleen encouraged us to think about resonances of between modern and medieval media technology and presented two related ideas. First, drawing on her experience with the few medieval texts surviving in large (200+) numbers&mdash;such as the Wycliffite Bible, Books of Hours, and late medieval statutes&mdash;she articulated the need for a “prosopography of the book.” As she walked a group of graduate students through a recent publication on the topic she demonstrated how large data sets might influence our understanding of individual codices. In her model Book History and Codicology&mdash;on discipline focused on social milieu the other on individual objects&mdash;are brought together in composite readings made possible, in part, by technological advances.

In her talk she expanded on these thoughts by situating “Old Media Studies” in relation to both New Media Studies and DH. In a provocative talk that brought together a diverse array of scholars and students she made the case for thinking about medieval texts and books in Media studies terms. Her talk explored both the intellectual opportunities such an approach provides as well as the pragmatic work the label might accomplish. Moreover, she argued that the intellectual and pragmatic work of “Old Media Studies” might actually be the same thing. In this, the allusion of her title is apt. Unlike the new wine shoved unto old wine skins that ruins both, the new wine skin preserves aged wine and protects it for the future.
