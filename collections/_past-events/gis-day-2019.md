The University of Virginia Library’s Scholars’ Lab with help from Albemarle County’s Office of Geographic Data Services would like to invite you for an afternoon of events celebrating [GIS Day](http://www.gisday.com/): Nov. 13th. All UVa and Charlottesville-area community members are welcome to attend.
 
1:30PM – Presentation: New(er) Tools in ArcGIS Online  
2PM – Lightning Round Talks  
3PM – GIS Day Cake  
 
*Location:* Alderman Library Electronic Classroom (ALD 421, just off Scholars’ Lab)
 
*Presentation: New(er) Tools in ArcGIS Online*  
At 1:30PM, join us for a session on new things happening with ArcGIS Online from crowdsourcing to interactive mapping applications to data analysis.
 
*Lighting Talks*  
Starting at 2PM, our tradition of lightning talks continues.  If you have never seen lightning round talks, they can be pretty entertaining: a rapid fire succession of speakers given a set, short amount of time and PowerPoint slides.  In previous years, many great presenters have shown the incredible breadth of disciplines and fields in which GIS is used in meaningful ways.  
 
*GIS Day Cake*  
Another great tradition continues.  Please join us for the GIS Day cake unveiling and partake in the feeding frenzy.
