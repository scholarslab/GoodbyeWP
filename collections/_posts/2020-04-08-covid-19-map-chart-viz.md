Using the Dashboard in ArcGIS Online, GIS Analysts [Chris](/people/chris-gist) and [Drew](/people/drew-macqueen) were able to pull in the Virginia Department of Health's COVID-19 Tableau data and create a [new map and chart visualizations](https://arcg.is/1fL0m1). The left pane is directly from the VDH website ([http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus](http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus)). The other panes were created for and maintained in ArcGIS Online. All the panes are adjustable to make them more easily viewable. You can explore the map and chart visualizations at [https://arcg.is/1fL0m1](https://arcg.is/1fL0m1).
