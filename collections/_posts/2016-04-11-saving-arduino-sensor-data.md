We had a need to take the temperature of an environment over a period of time, and record those temperatures for later analysis.

There are a number of options for recording sensor data.



	
  1. If connected to a computer, the data can be saved by reading the serial output and storing that in a file.

	
  2. If there is an SD card connected to the Arduino, the data can be saved directly to the SD card.


In this case, the Arduino needed to function by itself without being connected to a computer, so the sensor data needed to be saved to an SD card.Â We also needed the temperature sensor to be quite a distance from the Arduino and batteries, to minimize radiant heat affecting the temperature, so I soldered the sensor on to lengths of wire.

A number of extension shields offer SD card readers. We had a WiFi shield with an SD card reader, so that is the one I used.

There are some limitations with this set up. The biggest issue is that this set up does not include a time stamp with the temperatures. In order to get a timestamp, it is best to record the data with the Arduino connected to a computer, or a Raspberry Pi. See here for code to capture the sensor data on a computer (like a Raspberry Pi) using Python: [https://github.com/mossiso/arduino-tuts/tree/master/raspberry-pi](https://github.com/mossiso/arduino-tuts/tree/master/raspberry-pi)

Another way is to use a dedicated SD card shield with an RTC (Real Time Clock) built in, such as this one from adafruit: [https://www.adafruit.com/products/1141](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1141)

  }

    degreesC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0;
    degreesF = degreesC * (9.0/5.0) + 32.0;

    // write temps to Serial
    Serial.print("Celsius: ");
    Serial.print(degreesC);
    Serial.print(" Fahrenheit: ");
    Serial.println(degreesF);

    // close the file
    tempsFile.close();
  } else {

  }


  delay(delayTime);

}

float getVoltage(int pin)
{
