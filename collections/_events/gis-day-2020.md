Come celebrate international GIS Day on November 18th with the UVA Library Scholars' Lab. This year's event will be virtual and will be limited to a one hour session of short presentations. Unfortunately, we can’t provide a GIS Day cake, but feel free to enjoy your own sweet treat while we collectively celebrate all that is GIS.
 
All UVa and Charlottesville-area community members are welcome to attend. Registration is open and remains open until 1 hour before the event.
 
2:00 – 3:00 Presentations <br>
2:00 – 3:00 Eat your GIS Day cake proxy, or GIS Day cake if you’re feeling ambitious
 
Please distribute to interested parties. We hope you can join us on Nov 18th!
