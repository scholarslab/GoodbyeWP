Come learn about [FairCopy](https://www.faircopyeditor.com/en/), a new tool for studying and transcribing primary sources in literature and history. You can use FairCopy on a variety of texts, from novel-length works, to written correspondence, audio transcripts, dramatic productions, and more. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.

In this demonstration, we'll transcribe some of the personal correspondence of Mary Church Terell. Terell was a teacher and civil rights activist and a charter member of the NAACP. Her papers are kept at the Library of Congress. We will show how to take plain text transcriptions from the "By the People" project and produce structured text using FairCopy. We will also use FairCopy to mark names and places mentioned in her letters.
