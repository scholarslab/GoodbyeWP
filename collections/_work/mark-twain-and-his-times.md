This interpretive archive, drawn largely from the resources of the Barrett Collection, focuses on how "Mark Twain" and his works were created and defined, marketed and performed, reviewed and appreciated. The goal is to allow readers, scholars, students and teachers to see what Mark Twain and His Times said about each other, in a way that can speak to us today. Contained here are dozens of texts and manuscripts, scores of contemporary reviews and articles, hundreds of images, and many different kinds of interactive exhibits.

This project was a collaborative effort; in addition to the named team members above, support was provided by the University of Virginia Library (including the Scholars' Lab, E-Text Center, and Digital Curation Services) and the UVA Department of English. Filmed almost entirely on location at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library.
