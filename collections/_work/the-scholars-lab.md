The Scholars' Lab is itself scholarship: an active exploration of experimental and digital approaches to knowledge, realized by experts who each combine theory and practice, and bring humanities and cultural heritage informatics expertise to address interdisciplinary research questions.

As we discuss in our <a href="{{ site.url }}/charter">charter</a>, we believe that research needs to be combined with human care and community to become scholarship. From putting our budget dollars behind our values, to working on projects documenting trauma on campus, to internal policies that support work-life balance, we're working to both improve and document practices toward achieving a humane, ethical, and generative digital humanities community. 

In the future, we'll collect on this page a list of blog posts, presentations, and other ways of making this scholarship public.
