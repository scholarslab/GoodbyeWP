We frequently work with UVA faculty, and are especially interested in assisting:
* Faculty who don't do digital work, but are curious to learn more
* Faculty wishing to become digital scholars & methodological practitioners in their own right
* Existing digital scholars looking for advising, accomplices, or collaborators

Opportunities with SLab include:
* Consultations, scheduled by [emailing us](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu)
* Pedagogical collaboration (e.g. syllabi collaboration to add a DH component to a course; co-teaching by staff)
* Public space for showcasing data art and visualizations
* Connection to our international scholarly network for conferences, collaborators, job searches, scholarly communication and amplification, and other opportunities 
* DHSI tuition waivers (limited number each year, by application announced on blog)
* SLab staff partnership with other expert Library colleagues on the Library's Course Enrichment Grants and Faculty Research Sprints

See also our DH Center partners <a href="https://www.iath.virginia.edu/">IATH</a>, for their annual faculty fellowship opportunities.
