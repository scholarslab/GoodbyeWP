**Scholars' Lab Speaker Series: Shawn Graham**
**Practical Necromancy: Simulation and Agent Based Modeling in the Humanities**

In March, Dr. Shawn Graham, Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Carleton University, spoke about using agent based simulations to understand aspects of Greco-Roman antiquity.



Summary:
Raising the dead presents certain difficulties, but computation suggests a way forward. In Practical Necromany, Dr. Graham discusses the use of agent based simulations to understand aspects of Greco-Roman antiquity, its perils and potentials, and how all of this fits into a worldview informed by the digital humanities.
