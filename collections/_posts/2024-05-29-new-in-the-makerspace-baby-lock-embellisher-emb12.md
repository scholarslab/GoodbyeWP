Through a gratuitous donation, the Scholars' Lab Makerspace has acquired a Baby Lock Embellisher EMB12. This embellisher lets you felt all types of material including yarn and ribbon into various fabrics. The 12 barbed needles mesh material together without the need for thread. These needles are removable, so you can adjust the quantity to fit whatever project you are working on. Use all 12 to cover a large area rapidly or use a reduced amount for finer detailed work. Come test it out and add some flair to your clothing!
