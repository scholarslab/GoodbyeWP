Although we bring library, digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage skills to almost everything we work on, we are open and welcoming to folks in any discipline working in any field, and we regularly collaborate in almost every area on Grounds. An inexhaustive list of who we've worked with on Grounds includes folks from:

## Who are the scholars in "Scholars' Lab"?
Everyone! We define scholarship as one part critical thinking plus one part communicating the results of that thinking. Critical thinking can be accomplished through many methods, including research, writing, coding, building, designing, experimenting, and play. Communicating critical thinking can take the form of traditional publishing or other forms of “making public” such as tweeting and blogging, teaching, sharing open source code, or any other way for your intellectual community to learn from, critique, evaluate, and/or build on your work. When we refer to scholars, that includes anyone critically engaging with a concept: students, staff, faculty, and community members. On our website, the page that often gets titled "Projects" or "Research" or "Scholarship" on similar websites is titled "Our Work", to better reflect that our scholarship covers a broad variety of work.

Check out our [people](/people/) page for current staff, students, and alums.

## How does the Lab fit into the UVA Library?
The Scholars' Lab research center was founded in 2006. We’re part of <a href="http://library.virginia.edu">the UVA Library</a> and its mission to provide equitable access to knowledge and learning to everyone. Organizationally, we sit in the Library's Research & Learning Services unit led by Mira Waller, and the Library's Digital Humanities Center (created as an umbrella partnering us with frequent DH expert co-conspirators IATH). 

We frequently collaborate with our Library colleagues, including Preservation, Special Collections, Teaching & Learning, and subject liaison librarians. Some of these folks don't work directly with students, staff, or faculty outside the Library, but they're critical to everything we do. These colleagues include the Library's facilitates teams maintaining and securing our spaces, assisting with events logistics, and IT and UX support. Dave Hennigan helps us design and manage grant-supported scholarship.

We're also grateful for the frequent collaborators with us in the Library's Research Learning Services unit (Information Spaces & Services, Teaching & Learning, subject liaisons, and Research Data Services teams).

## How was this website made?
This website contains the collective effort of our [staff and collaborators](/people), past and present. The website has existed in multiple forms: as a WordPress site (?-2018); as a Jekyll-generated static website (2018-current), and same platform but with its latest theming (2024-current).

**The 2024 renewal of this website** incorporates the past work of many SLab staff, students, and community members, with new work by Amanda Visconti, Jeremy Boggs, and Laura Miller.

**The 2017-2018 renewal of this website** incorporates text, suggestions, and feedback from everyone on [the Scholars' Lab staff](/people). Additionally, the following folks put in significant extra effort on the site's design, coding, content, project management, and documentation: Katherine Donnally, Jeremy Boggs, Brandon Walsh, Ronda Grizzle, Laura Miller, Zoe LeBlanc, Ammon Shepherd, Shane Lin, Beth Mitchell, and Amanda Visconti. Check out our [site relaunch blog post](/blog/site-relaunch) for more information on how and why we moved our site from WordPress to its current Jekyll form.
