Please join us for a showcase of the work undertaken by the Scholars' Lab's Praxis Program students during their fellowship this past year. Praxis is a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities by way of project-based pedagogy and involves a range of activities, some individual and some collaborative. During this presentation the students will describe the work they developed for exercises related to DH community, research infrastructure, digital pedagogy, and humanities programming and design.

The 2023-2024 Praxis Fellows are

* [Arselyne Chery](http://scholarslab.org/people/arselyne-chery/), English
* [Molly Joyce](http://scholarslab.org/people/molly-joyce/), Music
* [Kathleen King](http://scholarslab.org/people/kathleen-king/), Music
* [Rachel Retica](http://scholarslab.org/people/rachel-retica/), English
* [Seanna Viechweg](http://scholarslab.org/people/seanna-viechweg/), English

Presentation will take place from 10:30-12:00 on zoom. This event can serve as a great introduction to digital humanities, the experience of working with the Lab, and ways to fulfill the practicum requirements of the DH certificate. Please register to receive zoom information.
