Songs of the Victorians is an archive of parlor and art song settings of Victorian poems, and also a scholarly tool to facilitate interdisciplinary music and poetry scholarship. Augmented Notes is a website where users upload scores, audio files, and measure information to produce websites like Songs of the Victorians, thus enabling scholars to pursue their own interdisciplinary projects.
