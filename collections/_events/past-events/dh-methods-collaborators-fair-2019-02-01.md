How did they make that?
What might a digital method do for my research?
What are the opportunities to learn more, or to begin a project?
Who can collaborate on my kind of research?

1:30 - 2:30: Short presentations of recent digital projects, spanning a variety of disciplines and methods, by faculty, graduate fellows, library staff, and others.
2:30 - 3:30: Open session to meet practitioners and scholars

Join us for an informal open house, hosted by the Scholars' Lab, and featuring IATH, SHANTI, and other members of the DH community. Meet fellow faculty, students, and library staff, find out about opportunities for fellowships or internal grants, chat with specialists in different kinds of research, and explore digital projects on screen.  You could also schedule a follow up consultation or find out how to apply for the various DH opportunities for graduate students and faculty at UVA.

Open to members of the University community.  Light refreshments will be served.
