**Scholars' Lab Speaker: Dot Porter**
**Ceci n'est pas un manuscript: How Digitization and Presentation Practices Ignore and Obscure the Physicality of the Object**

On October 30, 2013, Dot Porter, Curator of Digital Research Services at the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies in the Kislak Center for Special Collections at the University of Pennsylvania, spoke in the Scholars' Lab about the ways in which current manuscript digitization and presentation practices ignore and obscure the physicality of the object and offered some ideas for how to deal with it.

Ms. Porter joined us as part of the _Global Digital Libraries Symposium_, co-sponsored by Rare Book School, the Scholars' Lab, and the Buckner W. Clay Endowment for the Humanities at the Institute of the Humanities & Global Culture.
