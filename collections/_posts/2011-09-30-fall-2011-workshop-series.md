We'd like to invite you to our workshop series this fall.

Chris Gist and Kelly Johnston have created eight GIS workshops designed to take attendees from learning to create their first map using ArcGIS10 to mapping the world with Open Street Map. The series starts Tuesday, October 11, and will run weekly through November 29.

Nancy Kechner and Kathy Gerber of UVa ITS and the Scholars' Lab are offering six workshops introducing statistical software packages and data visualization. The series started on September 28, and runs through Wednesday, November 9.
