**Digital Humanities Speaker Series: Alan Liu & Rama Hoetlein**
**The History of Thought as Networked Community: The RoSE Prototype**

In March, Dr. Alan Liu, Professor in the Department of English at University of California, Santa Barbara,
and Rama Hoetzlein, Project Scientist, spoke about their work developing the RoSE Prototype.


Summary:
What if bibliographies of past authors and works could be modeled as a dynamic, evolving society linked to today's scholars and students?  What if scholars and students could add data about biographical, historical, and intellectual relationships to the bibliographical entries, thus using present-day crowdsourcing to make more socially meaningful the crowds of history?  And what if visualizations could help us actively "storyboard" intellectual movements and not just spectate them?  Alan Liu and Rama Hoetzlein present the conceptual framework and some of the discoveries and challenges of the RoSE Research-oriented Social Environment (in beta at the conclusion of a NEH Digital Humanities Start-up grant).

The Digital Humanities Speaker Series is co-sponsored by [IATH](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/), [SHANTI](http://shanti.virginia.edu/), and the [Scholars' Lab](http://www.scholarslab.org/).
