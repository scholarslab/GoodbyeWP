Today, we're very happy to announce that Dr. Katina Rogers is to join the [Scholarly Communication Institute](http://uvasci.org) and [Praxis Program](https://praxis.scholarslab.org) teams at the [Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org).

Katina comes to us from an appointment at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, where she has been responsible for a number of operational areas and has contributed to the strategic development of Sloan's [Digital Information Technology](http://www.sloan.org/program/28) program under the direction of Josh Greenberg. Her past work includes positions as Assistant Secretary General to the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, and as an instructor in language and literature courses at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where she completed her PhD in Comparative Literature in 2010.

In her new role as Senior Research Specialist for the Scholarly Communication Institute, Katina will help to support and share outcomes from a number of conversations SCI is convening: on emerging models for authoring and publication (with the [Alliance for Networking Visual Culture](http://scalar.usc.edu/anvc/), [PressForward](http://pressforward.org/), and the Modern Language Associationâ€™s [program in scholarly communication](http://www.mla.org/news_from_mla/news_topic&topic=303)); and on graduate education reform, with [CHCI](http://chcinetwork.org) and [centerNet](http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet). She will also plan and conduct a broad survey of humanities-trained respondents who self-identify as working in [alternative academic careers](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/alt-ac/), to illuminate perceived gaps in graduate-level preparation and help move _alt-ac_ conversations beyond the anecdotal. Finally, she will play a role in the planned expansion of the [Praxis Program](https://praxis.scholarslab.org) to a multi-institutional and international effort, geared toward sharing model programs and experiments in humanities methodological training.

Katina blogs at [Black Ink/White Page](http://katinarogers.com), and is [@katinalynn](https://twitter.com/#!/katinalynn) on Twitter. She will begin work with us in April and will be based in New York for the duration of this appointment. We're thrilled to welcome her to SCI and to the Scholars' Lab family!
