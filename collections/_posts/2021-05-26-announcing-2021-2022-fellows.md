We are thrilled to announce the 2021-2022 Scholar’s Lab fellows for the Praxis Program and the Graduate Fellowship in the Digital Humanities. We are welcoming 8 fellows from 5 disciplines from the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Our graduate fellows are joining a robust and vibrant community of past students!

## Praxis Program

We are delighted to welcome 6 team members to the 11th (!) year of the Praxis Program, our flagship introduction to digital humanities by way of collaborative, project-based pedagogy:

*	Susan Abraham, Spanish
*	Joseph Foley, History
*	Cherrie Kwok, English
*	Jennifer Marine, Art and Architectural History
*	Jacqueline Sahagian, History
*	Tarushi Sonthalia, English

Look forward to more details about the Praxis Program’s new project in the fall!

## Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities

Finally, we are looking forward to working with Alexander Christie and Michael VanHoose, our 2021-2022 Graduate Fellows in the Digital Humanities.

*	Alexander Christie's (Music, Composition & Computer Technologies) dissertation is titled "Reconfiguring Performer-Instrument Relationships in Experimental Electronic Music"
*	Michael VanHoose's (English) dissertation is titled "The Economics of the Novel in Britain, 1780–1836"

These fellows will work with our team throughout the year and over the summer on substantial research projects related to their dissertations. They join a vibrant community of students working in the lab in the coming year as Makerspace Technologists, Cultural Heritage Interns, GIS Technicians, and more.

Special thanks to everyone who served on the application committees that selected these fantastic students. We are looking forward to working with all of them in the coming year!
