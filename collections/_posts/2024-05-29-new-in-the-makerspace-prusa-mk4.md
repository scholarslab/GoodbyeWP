We have upgraded all our old Prusa i3 MK3S+ printers to the Original Prusa MK4. The MK4 features a print volume of 25 x 21 x 22 cm (9.84 x 8.3 x 8.6 in). Its more rugged build quality and new reinforced z-axis rods allow for significantly faster and more consistent prints. Autocalibration before each print helps to ensure a smooth first layer and is much faster than manual calibration. Come by and check it out!
