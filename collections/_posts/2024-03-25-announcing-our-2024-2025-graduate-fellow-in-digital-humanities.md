The Scholars' Lab is excited to announce next year's Graduate Fellow in Digital Humanities! Loren Lee (French) will join us for a year of concentrated digital work related to her dissertation entitled "The Life of Saint Mary the Egyptian: A Digital Critical Edition of the Old French Version T with English Translation." She joins a vibrant community of students working in the Lab in the coming year. Please welcome Loren!

Special thanks to everyone who served on the fellowship committees that selected our wonderful fellows next year. We look forward to working with Loren and our new [Praxis fellows](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/announcing-2024-2025-praxis-cohort/) in the coming months.
