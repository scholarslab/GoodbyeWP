Scholars' Lab maintains a collection of zines by authors and on topics of interest to the Lab and its community, including zines on feminist approaches to technology, digital scholarship tutorials, creativity and making, and social justice advocacy.

The project began pre-pandemic as a "Zine Wall" in a semi-public space that offered free copies of interesting zines as we happened upon them. The zine project has been virtual-only during the renovation of SLab's physical space in the Main Library (2020-2023). The project will be available to the public again as an expanded "Zine Library" project when SLab's physical space reopens in 2024, including a digital catalogue (currently in publicly viewable development), process for loaning the subset of zines that don't have unlimited copies, integration with other UVA Library zine-involved folks, and calls to our community to suggest specific zines or request zines on specific topics.
