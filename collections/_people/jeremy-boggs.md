I've been a practicing digital humanist for a little over two decades now. I have
a Master's degree in History, and have taught courses in history, graphic
design, new media, and American studies. As Head of Research & Development, I
focus on front-end development, user interface, user experience, and aesthetics
for Scholars' Lab projects, as well as leading the Scholars' Lab R&D team.
