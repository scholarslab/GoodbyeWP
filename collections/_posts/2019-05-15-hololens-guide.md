This guide offers instructions for how to get started with the HoloLens. While it is particular to using the equipment at UVA, there are probably some elements that can be transferred to other institutional contexts. Let's get started!

## Turn on HoloLens 
  1. Locate the power button at the end of the left arm, and press it for one second.
      <p align="center">
        <img src="/assets/post-media/2019-05-13-hololens-guide/2019-05-13-Buttons.png" width="260" height="190">
      </p>
      
  2. If the screen doesn’t light up, charge your HoloLens for at least 30 minutes before you try it again.
  3. You should see a page titled “Adjust your device to see all edges.” Follow the tutorial presented. If the screen shows the Start menu (shown below)  instead, please go to the section below headed “Reset and Turn Off HoloLens Before Returning” to reset your HoloLens.

      </p>
      
  4. Important:
  
     a. In the “Who owns this HoloLens?” page, select “I own it”, and click **Next**. 
  
## Basic Air Tap Gestures Review 
  1. **Air tap**: a gesture similar to a click; hold your finger straight out, then tap down.
  2. **Bloom**: a gesture that you use to bring up the home page (the Start menu); hold your fingertips together, then open them.

      </p>
  
## Connect to Network 
  1. Important:
  
      a. You will need to sign in to a secure WiFi network when you first set up your device. The Welcome_to_UVA_Wireless network will not work to set up this particular device. 
      
  2. Connect to your Home Network (after the first setup for the device): 
  
      a. **Start** →  **Settings** →  **Network & Internet** → choose your network 
  3. Connect to the UVA Wahoo network (UVA’s Unencrypted network) (after the first setup):
  
     a. Find wahoo in your HoloLens WiFi options list under “WiFi,” and click **Connect**. if you don’t see wahoo, find “Hidden Network: open” instead and enter the SSID: wahoo.

      </p>
 
## Manage Device in PC (Live view)    
  1.  Windows for HoloLens allows you to manage your device over Wi-Fi or USB. One of the features is the live view, where you can see your HoloLens display live on your PC.
  2. Make sure your HoloLens is on when you run the live view.
  3. Turn on the Developer mode and the Device Portal. 
  
      a. **Settings** → **Update & Security** → **For developers** →  Turn the **Developer mode** on and confirm → Turn **Device Portal** on 
      
      <p align="center">
        <img src="/assets/post-media/2019-05-13-hololens-guide/2019-05-13-Developer.png" width="240" height="180">
      </p>
      
  4. Look up your device’s IP address.
  
      a. **Start** →  **Settings** →  **Network & Internet** →  **Wi-Fi** → **Advanced Options** → Under **Properties**, get **IPv4 address**
      
  5. Open a web browser on your PC. 
      Type in https://<YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>, and press Enter. 

      a. Ignore message “Your connection is not private,” and click **Advanced**, then click **Proceed** to <YOUR_HOLOLENS_IP_ADDRESS>.
      
        <p align="center">
          <img src="/assets/post-media/2019-05-13-hololens-guide/2019-05-13-Privacy.png" width="380" height="277">
        </p>
      
      b. Tap **Request PIN** (only for the first time setting this up), and look at your HoloLens display. It should show a seven-digit Device Portal PIN.
      
       <p align="center">
          <img src="/assets/post-media/2019-05-13-hololens-guide/2019-05-13-Credentials.png" width="380" height="130">
        </p>
      
      c. Enter the PIN in the first box. Then create a username and password for the Device Portal (this does not need to be a Microsoft account), and click **Pair**.
      
      <p align="center">
          <img src="/assets/post-media/2019-05-13-hololens-guide/2019-05-13-Login.png" width="290" height="220">
       </p>
      
      d. In the pop-up Sign In box, re-enter the username and password you just entered. You will need to sign in every time you open the portal.
      
      e. After you are directed to the homepage, click on **Mixed Reality Capture** on the left bar, and click **Live Preview**. Then tap the white triangle **Start** button. You will see your current view in HoloLens on your PC.   
      <p align="center">

       </p>

## Reset and turn off HoloLens before returning
  1. Please make sure the battery level is above 40 percent before you attempt to reset it. 
  
      a. **Start Menu** → **Settings** → **Update & Security** → **Reset** → select **Reset device**, and confirm it again
      
      <p align="center">
          <img src="/assets/post-media/2019-05-13-hololens-guide/2019-05-13-Reset.png" width="380" height="120">
       </p>
      
      b. The reset process takes more than 11 minutes. Please be patient after the “Gears” page is gone; a Windows icon will appear within a minute.
      
      c. You can turn off the device when you see the “Adjust your device to see all edges” page. Press the power button for 4 seconds to turn it off. 
      
  2. Warning: please note that resetting your personal HoloLens means that all your personal data, including your downloaded apps and settings, will be removed.
  
## Next Steps

To help you gather app ideas from the over three hundred HoloLens apps in the Windows app store, we have selected a few great free apps to start with in the following categories:
  - Exploration 
  - Education 
  - Entertainment & Games


## Exploration 

1. [*Magic Window*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/magic-window/9nzcfqjv9vh7?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)

    Magic Window, created by 4 Fun Studio Inc., offers a choice of seven scenes, including the pyramids, outer space with aliens, a city with fireworks, and more. What’s great about this app is that it assigns different song effects to match the scene. The player can walk near the window to look closer and explore broader angles of the scene that can’t be seen from farther away.
