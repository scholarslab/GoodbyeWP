The [Zine Bakery](https://zinebakery.com) catalog is a public view of a subset of the Zine Bakery dataset. It includes most/all of the zines in my personal catalogue, but only a subset of the metadata fields—leaving out fields irrelevant to the public like how many copies of a zine do I have at home, or private data like links to private PDF backups of zines.

I recently set up a ["Zine Reader's View" here](https://airtable.com/appY7WyBFjSzLXQd6/shrVQlyCL7XZgeBrg), which is 1) only the zines that allow anyone to read them online for free, and 2) only includes my catalogue metadata of most interest to folks looking to read zines (e.g. the metadata about printing zines is hidden).

I also set up my catalogue to link readers directly to just zines with certain themes, like feminist tech zines and digital humanities zines!

(The "+" means that was the count of zines when I created these tags in early August, but I'm adding more zines all the time.)
