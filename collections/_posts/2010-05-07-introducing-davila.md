Jean Bauer, former Scholars' Lab Graduate Fellow in Digital Humanities announces: "I have just released my first open source project.  HUZZAH!"

DAVILA is a database schema visualization/annotation tool that  creates “humanist readable” technical diagrams.  It is written in [Processing](http://processing.org/) with the [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/) physics  library and released under GPLv3.  DAVILA takes in the database’s schema  and a pipe separated customization file and uses them to produce an  interactive, color-coded, annotated diagram similar in format to UML.   There are many applications that will create technical diagrams based on  database schema, but as a digital humanist I require more than they can  provide.  <!-- more -->

Technical diagrams are wonderfully compact ways of conveying  information about extremely complex systems.  But they only work for  people who have been trained to read them.  If you design a database for  a historian, and then hand him or her a basic E-R or UML diagram, you  will end up explaining the diagram’s nomenclature before you can talk  about the database (and oftentimes you run out of time before getting  back to the research question underlying the database).  This removes  the major advantage of technical diagrams and can also create an  unnecessary divide between the technical and non-technical members of a  digital humanities development team.

I have become fascinated by how documenting a project (either in  development or after release) can build community.  I’m not just talking  about user generated documentation (ala wikis), but rather the feeling  created by a diagram or README file that really takes the time to  explain how the software works and why it works the way it does.  There  is a generosity and even warmth that comes from thoughtful, helpful  documentation, just as inadequate documentation can make someone feel  stupid, slighted, or unwanted as a user/developer.  I will be writing on  this topic more in the months to come (perhaps leading up to an  article).  In the meantime, check out DAVILA and let me know what you  think.
