        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>The Scholars' Lab is an interdisciplinary research lab for critical,
            creative, and anti-oppressive explorations of the intersections of
            technology and culture. We offer mentoring, collaboration, and
            supportive space for anyone curious about pushing scholarly
            boundaries through creative, computational research practice. While
            much of our work deals with cultural and humanities questions, we
            welcome and routinely collaborate with all disciplines. Our staff
            offer deep expertise in digital humanities, computer and information
            science, spatial technologies, maker, and cultural heritage
            approaches. Our international scholarly leadership lets us connect
            UVA colleagues to the forefront of digital and experimental
            scholarship, collaborators, and opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Lab Space & Makerspace</h2>
        <h3>THE LAB</h3>
        <p>The Scholars’ Lab includes staff offices, co-working areas, an event
            space, a VR immersion space (<< LINK #tk), and data processing
                workstations. Appointments are encouraged if you want to meet a
                particular staff member or ensure access to specific equipment
                (<< Reservation info LINK #tk), though the space itself is open
                whenever Shannon Library is open.</p>
                <h3>THE LAB'S MAKERSPACE</H3>
                <p>The Makerspace is a place for tinkering and experimentation
                    with technologies like circuitry, 3D printing, and laser
                    cutting. Open to everyone, we specialize in applications and
                    research questions in the humanities and arts. The
                    Makerspace staff provides consultation and instruction
                    whenever the Makerspace is open, or by appointment. Please
                    drop in, or send inquiries to <a

        <h2>Digital Humanities Code + Design</h2>
        <p>We provide research and teaching consultation on a variety of digital
            humanities concepts, approaches, and tools, including digital
            collections & exhibitions, data collection and management, machine
            learning, text analysis, and more. Our particular strengths lie in
            the critical pedagogical and scholarly application of those
            technologies for the humanities.</p>

        <h2>Fellowships + Training</h2>
        <p>We support the work of emerging scholars and digital humanities
            practitioners. In addition to our general consultations, we offer
            three graduate fellowship programs that provide students with the
            time, space, and mentorship necessary to discover, explore, and
            build. We also offer a wide variety of opportunities for students
            and faculty to gain training and experience as digital humanists.
