Katherine did user experience, information architecture, and design for the Scholarsâ€™ Lab, for Neatline and other research projects. Previously, Katherine was a 2017 student intern in the lab, working as a Social Justice Developer, and in that role worked on redesigning Take Back the Archive on both the front and back end with an aesthetic focus on public usership at a time of heightened political awareness. Additionally, she is using the project as a case study for research on ethical design choices that respect the lives behind social justice causes without sacrificing visual interest.
