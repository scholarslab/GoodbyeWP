Please join us for a showcase of the work undertaken by the Praxis Program students during their fellowship this past year. Praxis is a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities by way of project-based pedagogy and involves a range of activities, some individual and some collaborative. During this presentation the students will describe the work they developed for exercises related to DH community, research infrastructure, digital pedagogy, and humanities programming and design. 

The 2022-2023 Praxis Fellows are

* Malcolm Cammeron, History
* Caroline Carter, Art and Architectural History
* Winnie Pérez Martínez, Spanish
* Samantha Stephens, English

Presentation will take place from 10:30-12:00 with lunch to follow. This event can serve as a great introduction to digital humanities, the experience of working with the lab, and ways to fulfill the DH certificate. We will also be offering a hybrid option for those unable to make it.
