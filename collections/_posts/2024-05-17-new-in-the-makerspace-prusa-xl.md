The Scholarsâ€™ Lab Makerspace has just made its newest addition to its 3D printing family. Our new Original Prusa XL is one of the biggest 3D printers on Grounds, with a print volume of 36 x 36 x 36 cm (14.17 x 14.17 x 14.17 in). Its five toolheads allow for up to five different filaments to be used together in a single print, whether to create a multicolour print or with specialty support materials. These independent toolheads also reduce filament waste, significantly reducing the amount of filament that needs to be purged during filament changes. Come by and check it out!
