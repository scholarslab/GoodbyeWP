The lab offers expertise in the critical digital humanities (DH), including through and about writing and theory, and active engagement with the international DH community. Beyond synchronous consultation, collaboration, teaching, staff-led research, and external leadership and service, we offer resources such as reading recommendations, a reference collection (Digital Humanities Working Library), written tutorials, and engaging external speakers.
