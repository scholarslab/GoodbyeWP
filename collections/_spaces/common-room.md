The Scholars' Lab Common Room provides twenty computer workstations in both solo and small group/collaborative configurations. Sunny and open, it can be enjoyed as study space as well, with additional seating for about thirty-two people at tables and chairs and another fourteen at the laptop bar with a view of the patio outside.

We hold regular Open Office Hours during fall and spring term at the discussion area at the south (main entrance) end of the room.

Here is whereÂ you will also find our [Makerspace](http://www.scholarslab.org/makerspace/).
