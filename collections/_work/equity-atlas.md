Equitable Analysis centers community-driven partnership to provide advocates as well as civic-and private-sector leaders with data and metrics, contextualized analysis, interactive maps and data visualizations, and narrative storytelling as a resource in pursuit of equity throughout the region.

Following the UVA Equity Centerâ€™s commitment to authentic partnership and shared power, we work with community members, rather than for. Through deep engagement with impacted communities, we gather insights and information to accurately measure and articulate regional patterns of racial and socioeconomic inequity, with an eye toward institutional accountability.

Guided by principles of justice, openness, accessibility, and reproducibility, these projects highlight critical assets in our region and underscore opportunities for collective action toward institutional and systemic change.

The Equity Atlas project was funded by the IMLS.
