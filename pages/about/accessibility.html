<p>As our Scholars&#39; Lab <a href="/charter/">charter</a> indicates, we are committed to making our projects and spaces accessible&mdash;in all meanings of that word&mdash;for everyone, regardless of ability or need. We believe accessibility is not an implementation that can be finished and done, but rather a way of thinking and working that can&mdash;and should&mdash;always be improved.</p>

<h2>Web accessibility</h2>
<p>In terms of web accessibility, we strive to make our the built environment of the Scholars&#39; Lab website and social media pleasant, easy to access, and <a href="http://www.ada.gov/">ADA-compliant</a>.

<p>For this website, we follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">WCAG 2.2 AA standard</a> or better, and <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> guidelines. Our markup and presentation adhere to W3G&#39;s standards for HTML5 and CSS3, and in doing so include many features meant to enhance the accessibility of our site, including:</p>
	
<ul>
<li>Correct ordering of headings to aid in navigation;</li>
<li>Alternative text for media where appropriate;</li>
<li>A skip link at the beginning of each page to jump to the page's main content;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles">ARIA roles</a> to better describe the purpose and content of various parts of our pages;</li>
<li>Alt text for images</li>
</ul>

<p>We use several tools to assess accessibility on our site, including the <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">Wave evaluation tool</a> by <a href="http://webaim.org">WebAIM</a> and <a href="http://pa11y.org/">Pa11y command line interface tool</a> by <a href="https://github.com/nature">Nature Publishing Group</a>.</p>

<p>We strive to follow similar practices on all our websites and when consulting and teaching about web design, aiming not for the legal minimum but for the best experience for all. For example, accessible and universal design are major components of our <a href="/praxis-program-fellowships">Praxis Program</a>'s <a href="https://designlab.jeremyboggs.net/lessons/accessibility.html">DesignLab</a> semester-long course, taught annually by <a href="/people/jeremy-boggs">Head of R&D Jeremy Boggs</a>. Jeremy was also an instructor for the <a href="https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/index.html%3Fp=11394.html">Building an Accessible Future for the Humanities Project</a>. Amanda Wyatt Visconti was a project team member and developer (at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities) on the <a href="https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/braillesc/">Making the Digital Humanities More Open</a> projects' development of a WordPress Braille plugin, allowing the vast amount of digital humanities WP-hosted content to become more easily Braille-readable.</p>

<p>On our social media, we strive to always use good descriptive alt text on images.</p>

<h2>Physical accessibility</h2>

<h3>Illness</h3>
If you have questions about or anticipate any issues with full access of our space and services, please <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">contact us</a> so we can help. We appreciate knowing where we can make improvements to increase our accessibility. Letting us know also allows us to put stories and numbers in support of accessibility improvements the university is aware are needed, but which don't yet have funding and/or are farther down the queue than other projects.

<p><a href="https://uvamagazine.org/articles/uva_drops_mandates_for_vaccines_indoor_masking">UVA does not currently require in classrooms or public spaces</a>, though these recomain recommended as an effective precautionary measure against spreading COVID-19, colds, flus, and other illnesses that can range from inconvenient to disabling or worse, especially for colleagues who are immunocompromised.</p>

<p>You can be contagious and not have any symptoms; home COVID tests are not 100% accurate. Please keep this in mind when we share space together. If you are feeling ill, we ask that you not attend events in our space; please <a href="mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu">contact us</a> to request virtual consultation or event attendance options.</p>

<p>We have extra masks available for attendees of events in our space who want one.</p>

<h3>Mobility, distance, & space use</h3>
<p>Directions on accessing our space are available on our <a href="/use-the-lab">"Use the Lab" page</a>.</p>

<p>Our new makerspace room (Shannon 308i) was designed with physical access in mind, and includes options like worktables that can be raised and lowered to wheelchair sitting and standing heights. Please contact <a href="/people/ammon-shepherd">Makerspace Manager Ammon Shepherd</a> if you have questions about physical makerspace access.</p>

<p>Some doors in the Shannon Library building do not currently offer push-button door-openers. These include several of our public doors, most of which we prop open during work hours (makerspace, consultation room, both entrances, grad office, doors between Text Aisle and Common Room). The door into our staff workroom space, behind which are several staff offices and our grad office, doesn't have a door-opener button and cannot be left propped open (due to the interior containing non-public space).</p>

<h2>Ongoing learning & research on accessibility</h2>

<h2>Federal access & accessibility requirements</h2>
<p>While some of this section may read as about accessibility requirement compliance, we strive to fill or exceed both the letter and the spirit of these requirements. Comparing required practice to our past/current practice will help us identify places we can do better, or where another consideration outweighed a more accessible practice (meaning that decision should be revisited and reweighed).</p>

<h3>Federally-funded research: access memo</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-access-Memo.pdf">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memo</a> was sent to all federal agencies in 2022. Then-acting OSTP director Alondra Nelson called on all federal grant makers to establish plans that “ensure free, immediate, and equitable access to federally funded research.” The memo discusses access in a broad sense, ensuring the public is aware of and can easily access the fruits of federally funded research, a goal that includes attention to web accessibility—requiring:</p>

<ol>
<li>"publications and their supporting data resulting from federally funded research [to be made] publicly accessible without an embargo on their free and public release;</li>
<li>Establish[ment of] transparent procedures that ensure scientific and research integrity is maintained in public access policies; and,</li>
<li>Coordinat[ion] with OSTP to ensure equitable delivery of federally funded research results and data."</li>
</ol>

<p>In seeking to understand these requirements as well as support their underlying goals, we also consulted the currently in-progress <a href="https://www.neh.gov/publicaccess">NEH's Public Access Plan page</a>, which is limited to peer-reviewed journal articles and a subset of research datasets. The NEH clarifies the memo's scope, noting that for NEH-funded research "because NEH funds many areas of the humanities beyond academic research, grantees who are not actively publishing work based on their awards may find the Public Access Plan has minimal impact. Indeed, the plan will primarily affect academic institutions and scholars who receive NEH awards for research and writing, and subsequently publish in peer-reviewed journals... The NEH Public Access Plan does not apply to monographs or chapters in edited volumes".</p>

<h3>Federal ADA requirements</h3>
<p>WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is federally required by April 2026. As noted above, we already voluntarily follow these guidelines or better with our current work. Therefore, our focus will be on making sure that voluntary following converts to mandatory; that all staff understand how to follow and advise on these requirements; that we include advising and discussion of these requirements in projects, consults, and collaborations going forward; and that we address legacy projects that may not fully follow these guidelines.</p>

Section 508

Elyse discussed the exceptions to certain compliance rules, highlighting five types of exceptions that are relevant to their work. She explained the criteria for each exception, emphasizing that pre-existing social media posts and archived web content do not require remediation, while other exceptions require specific criteria to be met. Elyse also clarified that minor deviations from standards might be acceptable if they do not significantly impact user experience.



<h3> Our work + the federal access & ADA requirements</h3>
<p>Much of our work already meets these required guidelines, as part of our following best practices, though this is not true of all our work (especially as we move further into the past, given best practices and the Web have evolved since our 2006 creation as a research center). This section discusses work that may need added or different approaches given the new guidelines.</p>

<p>Areas of our projects needing special accessibility attention and practice are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Datasets (both as research output focus, or that are possible to pull out from e.g. web projects)</li>
<li>Site content (text, images, media)</li>
<li>Site design & functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>Our approach also differs depending on our style of involvement:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Projects initiated or co-initiated by SLab staff</strong></li>
<li><strong>Collaborations led by folks other than SLab staff</strong> (e.g. Praxis Fellows annual hackathons, IATH Fellowships we collaborate on, non-SLab-faculty-led projects)</li>
<li><strong>Consultation without collaborative contribution</strong> (e.g. reference consultation and informal modes of advising, mentoring, providing feedback) => advise on best practices as well as requirements, as a built-in practice; point consultees to resources such as <a href="https://accessibility.virginia.edu/">UVA'S Accessibility website</a></li>
</ol>

<p>We divide our approach by the status of a research project:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Past projects that have been archived</strong>: These mostly fall into
    <ul><li>a website that's no longer online, but still has online presence such as a GitHub repo => mark the repo using GH's "archive" function so it's clear the work precedes these guidelines</li>
    <li>a project that's been through, is currently in, or is intended to go into the Special Collections DH preservation pipeline as soon as it's accepting more projects => allow Special Collections to handle if/how guidelines apply; for projects waiting to enter pipeline, we could optionally add a note to the project's homepage indicating its archival and pre-guideline status</li></ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Past projects/projects without current research work, that are still live online</strong>: We can add a note to the project's homepage indicating its past, pre-guideline status; additionally, we can contact and advise the project owner on steps to make the project meet the guidelines, and which if any of these are mandated vs. simply recommended best practices for optimal project access.</li>
<li><strong>Current in-progress projects</strong>: (plan in development; more to come soon!)</li>
<li><strong>Future projects</strong>: (plan in development; more to come soon!)</li>
</ol>

<p>While these guidelines focus on outputs and activities such as writing, data, code, and websites, our research extends to a variety of formats including our public spaces and services, community design, events, and social media. We strive to bring the values driving these guidelines to all these areas.</p>
