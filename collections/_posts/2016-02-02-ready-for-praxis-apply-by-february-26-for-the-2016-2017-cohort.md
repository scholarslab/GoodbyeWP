UVa grad students! Apply by  **February 26** for a unique, funded opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary group of your peers, learning digital humanities skills from the experts, and collaboratively designing and executing an innovative digital project. The 2015-2016 Praxis cohort is in full swing, thanks to a generous support by [UVa Library](http://www.library.virginia.edu) and [GSAS](http://gsas.virginia.edu).

Each year, the Scholars’ Lab [Praxis Program](http://praxis.scholarslab.org) provides six UVa graduate students with hands-on experience in digital humanities collaboration and project creation. Team members work to take a shared project from conception to design and development, and finally to publication, community engagement, and analysis. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our  faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both the the fellowship project and their future research.

In 2012-2013, the Scholars’ Lab joined with like-minded institutions to create the [Praxis Network](http://praxis-network.org), made up of allied but differently-inflected humanities education initiatives from around the world, mainly focused on graduate training, and all engaged in rethinking pedagogy and campus partnerships in relation to the digital humanities. The Praxis Network Student Directory showcases Praxis Program alumni have traveled diverse career paths, including tenure-track teaching positions and digital humanities positions within academic libraries and research centers.

We will welcome six new, competitively-selected Praxis students in late August 2016. _**The Praxis fellowship replaces teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote approximately 10 hours per week in the fall and spring semesters**_, to learning together and building a collaborative digital humanities project in the Scholars’ Lab. Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars’ Lab, and can make use of a dedicated grad lounge.

All University of Virginia graduate students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply to join the 2016-17 cohort. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.

The application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews (_which will be scheduled for 3/7/2016, 3/9/2016, and 3/11/2016_) as well as input from peers.

To start, we only ask for a letter of intent, sent to [Purdom Lindblad](mailto:jpl8e@virginia.edu). The letter should include:

- the applicant’s research interests;
- summary of the applicant’s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;
- summary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program
- summary of what the applicant hope to gain as a Praxis Fellow


Questions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to: [Purdom Lindblad](mailto:jpl8e@virginia.edu)
