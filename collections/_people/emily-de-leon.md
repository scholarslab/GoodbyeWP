Hello! My name is Emily de Le√≥n. I am an uprising senior at DePaul University in Chicago, double majoring in Latin American and Latino Studies and Spanish Studies. I am currently a LAMI Scholar, a McNair Scholar, in hopes in pursuing a PhD in Latin American Cultures. The research I am working on this summer at UVA is about redefining what the Assimilation Theory is within the Latin American communities in the United States.
