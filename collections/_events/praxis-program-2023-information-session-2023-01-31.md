Praxis Applications are due soon! See the official CFP for more details about the fellowship [itself](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/praxis-program-fellowships/). If you have questions about the Scholars’ Lab’s year-long, soup-to-nuts introduction to Digital Humanities please attend this information session to be held January 31st, 2023 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom. Please register to attend. If you’re interested in discussing your application earlier or individually, we highly encourage students to write to [Brandon Walsh](mailto:bmw9t@virginia.edu). Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.
